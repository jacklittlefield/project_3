My FIRE target is within the next few years and still working on the right time to balance enough nest egg with the risks for a longer retirement plan (maybe as long as 55 years).  I am very concerned about Sequence Risk (a long period of below average returns early in my retirement).  For the last ten years, we have enjoyed a good stock market with an annualized return above 12% and most indicators at or near their peaks.  This can't go on forever, as much as we would love that!

As of today the Shiller CAPE is at 33 which is near the high end of historic valuations. There is some debate how accurate the CAPE is since it uses ten year historic earnings and may over inflate valuations but there is good research to suggest CAPE has some predictive value on longer term, \~10 year trends.

Kitces has done a ton of research on valuations and SWR and some of his articles suggest the 4% SWR still holds up even through periods of significant sequence risk including one of the worst period from 1966 to 1981. Even then the 4% SWR held up at least for a 30 year retirement.  But what happens for longer periods?

I wanted to be able to factor in sequence risk in my own planning and did not find good data to show how to model it.  I created my own historic statistical model for High, Medium, and Low sequence risk to use for the market performance for the first ten years of retirement.  It uses the current CAPE and past market performance for following ten year periods and then estimates the average return and standard deviation.    From here we can use this in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate performance for the initial ten years of retirement when subject to sequence risk.

The market data I extracted is in the table below:  You can see these returns are well below the long term average for the S&amp;P500.

&amp;#x200B;

|Sequence Risk Level|Schiller CAPE|Average Return|Standard Deviation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|High|33|3.0%|4.75%|
|Medium|25|4.3%|5.4%|
|Low|20|6.2%|7.8%|

&amp;#x200B;

I have much more details in how we derived the above data [here](https://feedingourfire.com/2018/09/sequence-risk-will-it-effect-your-retirement-plans) if you want to dig deeper.

Given the current CAPE at 33,  we used the high risk data and adjusted our retirement planning model to lower expected returns for the initial ten years.  We initially predicted a 98% probability of success at a 4% SWR.  When we factor in Sequence Risk the probability dropped to 70%, Yikes!  

This suggests in this case the 4% SWR for a 55 year retirement subject to initial Sequence Risk does not hold up.  Of course, this is modeled around our own specific situation so others may not see the same impact.

One interesting thing in our model even with sequence risk, the 4% rule has a 98% chance of success for 25 years and we would be eligible for Social Security well before this.  Our current model does not factor in SS so we will consider that to see if it makes a difference for our planning.  We are old enough were SS should still be pretty secure though planning for only 70% of the benefits.

We also have a ton of flexibility in our plans.  We may postpone our retirement plans a little to increase our nest egg above 4% SWR but we don't want to be too conservative.  I am already almost 50 so don't want to work too many more years.  We don't hate our jobs but are ready to start the next phase of our lives and focus on some hobbies and things we enjoy.  My wife is already open to Barista FIRE or part time side hustle too.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to see how others who are close to or recently retired are factoring in Sequence Risks and have you adjusted your plans?  What Withdrawal Rate are you planning for?  Do you have any contingency plans?  Am I being too cautious in my concerns?

&amp;#x200B;

*tl;dr  With market valuations high, at least based on the Schiller CAPE ratio at about 33, will our retirement plans suffer from really low returns the next ten years (i.e. Sequence Risk).  We had been planning on a 4% SWR but when we consider sequence risk potential in the next few years it looks like 4% may not be as safe.  If you plan to retire soon, what are you doing to account for Sequence Risks?*

My situation.

Age: 30

70k Income

40k In various Retirement Accounts

68k Mortgage 4.75% Interest +1.3% PMI, Home Market Value \~160K Monthly Pmt $278

13k Car loan 6.0% Interest Monthly Pmt $221

16k Car Loan 3.1% Interest Monthly Pmt $291

17k Travel Trailer (Family Vacations) 6.5% Interest Monthly Pmt $170

13k Student Loans 5.4% Interest Monthly Pmt $245

No Credit Card Debt!

&amp;#x200B;

So as you can see this 15k would pretty much kill one of these loans. My first option is putting it against the mortgage which would set me up for a three year payoff. Second option, pay a loan off and refinance mortgage to get a better rate and no PMI and keep it for a longer period say 10 years or so (This would require about 3k in fees). Or don't pay any towards debt and invest for retirement. I'm Leaning towards the Mortgage because in the long run that would save me the most money, but also thinking cash flow where I could use the Monthly Pmt to roll into the next debt. Hopefully my thoughts make sense and I look forward to any advice! Thanks Everyone.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So through planning and some luck I have about 15k coming my way in the next couple months and I really want to put it to the best use. My situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age: 30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70k Income&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40k In various Retirement Accounts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;68k Mortgage 4.75% Interest +1.3% PMI, Home Market Value ~160K Monthly Pmt $278&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13k Car loan 6.0% Interest Monthly Pmt $221&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16k Car Loan 3.1% Interest Monthly Pmt $291&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17k Travel Trailer (Family Vacations) 6.5% Interest Monthly Pmt $170&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13k Student Loans 5.4% Interest Monthly Pmt $245&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Credit Card Debt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can see this 15k would pretty much kill one of these loans. My first option is putting it against the mortgage which would set me up for a three year payoff. Second option, pay a loan off and refinance mortgage to get a better rate and no PMI and keep it for a longer period say 10 years or so (This would require about 3k in fees). Or don&amp;#39;t pay any towards debt and invest for retirement. I&amp;#39;m Leaning towards the Mortgage because in the long run that would save me the most money, but also thinking cash flow where I could use the Monthly Pmt to roll into the next debt. Hopefully my thoughts make sense and I look forward to any advice! Thanks Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

It looks like from what I have seen CALPERS has pretty limited options for funds.  It looks like they have 5 funds all from State Street:

1) Russell 3000 Index

2) MSCI ACWI ex-USA IMI Index (International)

3) Barclays Capital US Aggregate Bond Index

4) REIT fund

5) US Treasuries

I'm not sure if he has the option to put his money in these directly or if he has to choose one of the target date funds that are offered composed of varying percentages of the above.  All of the funds are in the .40-.55% ER range.

He and my sister don't have a lot of disposable income so he won't be maxing this out for sure.  Based on this I think it would make sense for to contribute any amount he needs to get a match, but then put everything else into in IRA where the fund selection is significantly better.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be meeting with him in a couple of weeks so we can go over their taxes/income/old retirement accounts and figure out whether they should keep funds in their old 401ks or roll them over to an IRA and potentially do a Roth conversion.  Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.

FedFIRE!

Prepare yourself for one heckuva ramble.

**A little background…**

For those who are interested, I’ve posted two extensive “Ask Me Anythings” 7 and 4 years ago look at the posts I’ve submitted, I’m not active in this username otherwise).  I am an edge-case, in that both my wife and I work as Foreign Service Officers (FSOs), which referred to as being a tandem couple.  As such, we have not spent *all* of our careers overseas.  In the end, I do believe we will come out ahead, as we’ve made the “sacrifice” to work in the DC region when both of us can’t get jobs in the same embassy.  This has basically meant we passed up one 3-year tour (so far) in order to keep us both working at full-salary.  We have friends and colleagues who are also tandem couple who have chosen *not* to do this.  They invariably choose to go to low-cost of living (LCOL) posts, so one salary can take them much further.

**The Perks of Being a ~~Wallflower~~ FSO**

So, FedFIRE?  Well, if you’re a federal employee, there are a couple of ways to retire early, and plenty of routes to financial independence, but I happen to be in the unusual (in a good way) position of being able to retire as early as 50 under the Foreign Service (Dept. of State, if unclear).

This special retirement provision applies to State, federal law enforcement, and I think a few other random federal jobs (maybe nuclear inspectors...I’ve never been able to get a clear answer).  If you have 20+ years of service *and* you’re 50, you can retire with a “pension” of 1.7% times your years of service.  The actual value of your pension is based off the average of your three highest annual salaries.  For each year worked *after* 20 years, you only get an additional 1% (not 1.7%).  You can also draw down your TSP / 401k with *no* penalty.  This is basically known as FERS Special (or Special FERS, if you nasty).

To keep the numbers simple, if someone with an average high-3 salary of $100,000 retired exactly at 50 with exactly 20 years of service, they’d get (1.7 x 20) 34% of $100,000 — $34,000 a year, paid out monthly.  To further clarify, if you worked 21 years, you get 35%, not 35.7%.  The government *does* provide COLA (cost of living adjustments)...most of the time, and there is a formula they use to keep it in line with (but technically less than) inflation.  

Additionally, because you can retire early, you also get supplemental payments to make up for Social Security eligibility until age 62 (this supplement gets diminished / goes away if you earn wages in excess of about $15,000, so careful with that side-hustle, I guess).  The supplement is calculated by taking your years of service divided by 40 times your estimated minimum social security payment.  At 50 years, this would be in the $1000-$1300 range for most people.  So, without saving a dime, the hypothetical $100,000 foreign service officer can pull down $46,000 a year.  To be clear, we are fully eligible for social security from the minimum age onward, so that income would technically increase even if taken immediately at 62.

Now we have the other leg, TSP...the government’s 401k.  Most government agencies match up to 5%, and with 20 years of service, it’s entirely reasonable (at full IRS limits) to put away $400,000, assuming minimal to no growth.  A 4% SWR gives you about $1300 a month, or $15,500 a year.

So, boom, over $61,000 of income a year.

Then there’s healthcare...which you get to keep after retirement, and the government still pays their share.  I considered this to be *the* key element of my retirement, as it diminishes an otherwise significant expense.  Finally, you also can maintain your life / disability insurance at a discount (though most reduce the coverage).

Oh, and by the way, my wife gets the same benefits (humble brag).

So, boom x 2, over $122,000 per year, assuming we both only make $100k as our high-3 salaries (we actually have made more due to occasional warzone compensation and such), and our TSP accounts have been doing much better.  Pretty darned sweet.

**Fallout 3: The Realities of Living in the DC Wasteland**

It is not all wine and roses (well, there *always* wine...and liquor, and beer), but not all roses, at least.

When I started in the federal government, and not as an FSO, my salary was about $28,000...GS-07 in the early 2000s, for those wondering.  I worked my way up in my career and made some not-great financial decisions like taking on too much student debt, and buying a condo/townhome at the absolute height of the market pre-housing crisis — an ARM too.

Additionally, and this pains me to this day...I was advised by my HR in my first government job to cash out my TSP because I was going back to grad school and I only had a couple thousand in the account. Boo!

Even so, my career hasn’t been $100k+ a year since day one, but a steady slog of promotions, cost-of-living adjustments, and time-in-grade increases.  I *haven’t* been able to contribute the IRS max to my TSP for my entire career, though I have taken advantage of max employer matching since entering federal service.

Both my wife and I had student loans, and they are now paid off in our early 40s.

We *still* own our underwater condo/townhome, though we are renting it out.  Within six months of buying the property, we were almost $100k underwater.  This has never recovered, and the neighborhood has gone downhill due to multiple foreclosures and short-sales over the past decade.  We have taken a loss on this property, rent-wise, every time we rented it out while overseas (though only a couple hundred a month, so 90%+ of the mortgage was covered.  This isn’t *so* dire, because while overseas, your housing in the host country is paid for, so it was kind of like maintaining a $200 mortgage for X number of years.  We intend to sell the townhome next summer once our tenants’ lease is up, likely at a break-even point.

From a real estate perspective, this property has kicked our butts, as the ARM was okay for a few years, but now with rising rates, the rental loss is going up every year, especially as HOA fees have risen with no improvement in services.  Contrary to what many claim, it is entirely possible to not “win” in real estate in Northern Virginia (and no, I’m not discounting the reality of the ARM or the housing crisis).  I would not have predicted the neighborhood we were in to turn to low-income in less than five years, but it did.  To be clear, the neighborhood is still perfectly safe, as ethnically diverse as it ever was, but the schools went downhill due to the tax base, and the property values never recovered post-crash.  We have a secondary e-fund set up to cover paying the mortgage for up to a year, in the event it doesn’t sell in the first few months.  By that point, we might consider refinancing (assuming we have enough equity to satisfy investment property re-fi requirements), and renting it out again (though I *really* loathe being a landlord).

Living in the DC region as a whole is expensive and difficult...groceries, commutes, high cost of living for everything else.  This isn’t uncommon for *any* metro area, but it’s a constant reminder of what we’re missing overseas.  We made a decision to move farther out into Loudoun County and bought a second giant house (cliche), but now we have a kid, and we expect to be a multi-generational family, with (hopefully) grandparents moving in very soon.  We want this for the kid, and difference in mortgage between our crappy townhome and the new place is only $900, but a difference of 1200 to 4200 sq ft (I imagine some people choking at this on this sub!).  We also moved strategically within a few miles of the future Ashburn and Dulles metro stations, but for now the commutes are an hour-plus via bus.  That said, our property values have increased by 10%+ over the past year, and the metro won’t even be here for two years or so, so we’re doing waaay better than our last attempt at real estate (and to be honest, if it never went up, I’d still be totally cool with that).

We would like to go overseas at least one more time, though the realities of grandparents in their late 60s / early 70s and a kindergarten-aged child mean we need to be very strategic about that.  We took the kid with us to our last post in Brussels, but they don’t remember any of it, as they were 1.5 to 4.5 during that time frame (the kid spoke French first, but doesn’t remember a word now that we’ve been back for a year).

Regardless, we have planned for the “worst” case (really not *that* bad, just not ideal) of continuing to live and work in the DC-region until retirement eligibility as early as 7 years from now.

**What RE means to ME**

Okay, so here’s some real numbers…

We are 42 and 43.

Kid is 5.

Our expenses are $90k a year.  (Shock!  Horror!)  This includes a rental property (and associated expenses) losing us money *and* childcare (technically *also* losing us money...darned unemployed 5 year old!), which is about 18% of that total.  Both of these expenses will go away before retirement.

Our only liabilities are a $500k mortgage (new house) and the remaining $250k mortgage on old townhome.  That seems like a lot of money, but not really for NoVA.  We got rid of student loans, cars are paid off, and have no credit card debt.

We have about $600k in our TSP.  Assuming literally no growth, just base contributions, we will have $900k by the earlier eligible retirement date.

We have about $100k in stock investments.  We contribute about $10k a year to that, so, again, assuming no growth, about $170k by minimum retirement.  I view this as the kid’s college fund, assuming they want to go to college, or college exists in its current form.

Running out the retirement benefits, our pensions alone will cover 90% of our current expenses.  The social security “supplement” will cover the rest with room to spare.  This ignores drawing down on the TSP funds.

Our annual pre-tax income would be about $140,000.  After taxes (effectively in the high teens, likely), probably about $118,000.  That leaves us with about $2300 of “whatever” money per month.  This is all based on current salary, no expectation of real retirement fund growth, and the assumption of our current expenses of $90k.

**Man Plans and Spouse Laughs**

“You want to retire at *fifty*?  You’re crazy.  The kid will be 13!  What will you do?  We can’t afford that!”

Technically, in the government, there’s no real “FU” money point.  I mean, even if I had a significant windfall (let’s say $1 million, though I have no wealthy relatives), I would not give up my pension or health care.  I *will* work until at least 50...I kind of want to, so I have that going for me.  That said, I’m technically eligible to retire *before* then, I just wouldn’t be able to collect a pension or anything until 50.

I am in the slow and steady process of convincing my wife that the numbers associated with our finances are, you know, *real*.  She handles the budget (daily expenses), but I handle the big picture / retirement.  Other than an actual 4% SWR, my numbers are crazy conservative.  I assume *no* gains in any of our current accounts.  I’m not Warren Buffett (or Jimmy, for that matter), but even if all our money was just in the G Fund under the TSP, we’d be guaranteed bond-level rates of returns.  In reality, the bulk of our money is in the C, S, and I Funds (Large Cap, Small Cap, and International stocks).

My plans include leaving NoVA, possibly to the Carolinas, Georgia, or Florida near (but not on) the beach to a single-level, single-family home.  I’ve been watching a lot of *Island Life* on HGTV, and it is probably detrimental…  ;)

The going rate for these places right now is anywhere from $200-400k, which seems crazy cheap to me coming from DC area (we’d be able to buy in cash if we wanted).  We plan to spend about 90 days (max no-visa required in most countries) a year overseas in short-term rentals, maybe not every year, but close to it in the first decade or so.  We’ve traveled a ton, so our vision is basically enjoying the day-to-day life overseas without having the hassle of real ex-pat issues (having worked American Citizen Services, I have no desire for the type of troubles real ex-pats run into).

**Random Considerations, Questions, and Miscellania**

* If we retire at 50-ish the kid will still be in middle school / high school.  Should we move to warmer climes at that point or stick it out until graduation (could still be retired, just living in crappy NoVA)?

* We don’t *have* to retire at 50, but there is max date in FERS Special.  There is *some* flexibility in the event the market goes kablooey (sorry for using technical terms).

* Retiring *before* the kid is in college means we can’t sneak her in the back door at State (or not as easily).  Passing up a possible “easy” career entry for the kid is significant concern (for me, at least; who knows, the kid may be a libertarian and hate the government / civil society).  First world problems, I guess.

**EDIT EDIT EDIT**  There is no backdoor to be an FSO.  Did not mean to imply it.  There are internal nominations for civil service and internships, though.  **END EDIT**

* People talk about “side-hustles”, but I have no freaking clue if there’s something I want to do.  I can’t really blog about State stuff, which seems to be the default thing, but I really do need to spend some time thinking about *what* real retirement would look like.

**What Motivates You to Be a Lazy Bum?**

Why retire so early, when the life of a diplomat is so totes awesome?  It is and it isn’t.  My wife and I both had an involuntary “come to Jesus” (the hard way) moment during the metro bombing in Brussels.  I had just exited the metro in Arts-Loi  and was entering the US Embassy when the bomb went off.  My wife was exiting at Schumann.  These stops are at either side of the Maelbeek explosion.  If I hadn’t skipped a coffee that morning and my wife hadn't had an appointment at the EU, well…my username is unintentionally ironic.  

The thing is, I’ve been shot at in a warzone, been in a pretty bad car accident, was accidentally driven into a minefield (got out safely, though), all with work, but you don’t expect this stuff in the “easy” posts.  The things that seemed “part of the job” a few years ago don’t necessarily seem worth it these days.  A good friend of mine lost his arm a month ago to infection while serving in Africa.  It was from a scratch, not a severe injury.  Another colleague of mine was stabbed repeatedly in Latin America for trying to escape an extortionate cab driver.  Dead now.  A classmate of mine from my early FSO training was assaulted when she decided to come home early from work and walked in on her house being burglarized.  She was beat up, but otherwise okay.  This isn’t always an easy job, let alone a fun job.  We’ve all served places where our lives are literally on the line...and while I can’t avoid “life”, generally speaking, I do feel safer in the US than in Nicaragua, Russia, or, Nigeria.

Less than a decade...that’s the way I see.  I’m doing my job (and then some), but the light at the end of the tunnel...that’s in sight.

Thanks for reading.  Feel free to ask almost anything.  I’m happy to add more depth to whatever I touched on, though I will be a little coy about exactly where I served in some instances (dates, in particular), as you can very quickly dox me like this.

**tl;dr:** FSO and FSO wife can technically retire at 50.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, yinz...long-time lurker, first-time poster, but I thought you might like to hear about my sort-of alternative path to FIRE.  FedFIRE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare yourself for one heckuva ramble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A little background…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested, I’ve posted two extensive “Ask Me Anythings” 7 and 4 years ago look at the posts I’ve submitted, I’m not active in this username otherwise).  I am an edge-case, in that both my wife and I work as Foreign Service Officers (FSOs), which referred to as being a tandem couple.  As such, we have not spent &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of our careers overseas.  In the end, I do believe we will come out ahead, as we’ve made the “sacrifice” to work in the DC region when both of us can’t get jobs in the same embassy.  This has basically meant we passed up one 3-year tour (so far) in order to keep us both working at full-salary.  We have friends and colleagues who are also tandem couple who have chosen &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do this.  They invariably choose to go to low-cost of living (LCOL) posts, so one salary can take them much further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Perks of Being a &lt;del&gt;Wallflower&lt;/del&gt; FSO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, FedFIRE?  Well, if you’re a federal employee, there are a couple of ways to retire early, and plenty of routes to financial independence, but I happen to be in the unusual (in a good way) position of being able to retire as early as 50 under the Foreign Service (Dept. of State, if unclear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This special retirement provision applies to State, federal law enforcement, and I think a few other random federal jobs (maybe nuclear inspectors...I’ve never been able to get a clear answer).  If you have 20+ years of service &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you’re 50, you can retire with a “pension” of 1.7% times your years of service.  The actual value of your pension is based off the average of your three highest annual salaries.  For each year worked &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; 20 years, you only get an additional 1% (not 1.7%).  You can also draw down your TSP / 401k with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; penalty.  This is basically known as FERS Special (or Special FERS, if you nasty).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the numbers simple, if someone with an average high-3 salary of $100,000 retired exactly at 50 with exactly 20 years of service, they’d get (1.7 x 20) 34% of $100,000 — $34,000 a year, paid out monthly.  To further clarify, if you worked 21 years, you get 35%, not 35.7%.  The government &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; provide COLA (cost of living adjustments)...most of the time, and there is a formula they use to keep it in line with (but technically less than) inflation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because you can retire early, you also get supplemental payments to make up for Social Security eligibility until age 62 (this supplement gets diminished / goes away if you earn wages in excess of about $15,000, so careful with that side-hustle, I guess).  The supplement is calculated by taking your years of service divided by 40 times your estimated minimum social security payment.  At 50 years, this would be in the $1000-$1300 range for most people.  So, without saving a dime, the hypothetical $100,000 foreign service officer can pull down $46,000 a year.  To be clear, we are fully eligible for social security from the minimum age onward, so that income would technically increase even if taken immediately at 62.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have the other leg, TSP...the government’s 401k.  Most government agencies match up to 5%, and with 20 years of service, it’s entirely reasonable (at full IRS limits) to put away $400,000, assuming minimal to no growth.  A 4% SWR gives you about $1300 a month, or $15,500 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, boom, over $61,000 of income a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s healthcare...which you get to keep after retirement, and the government still pays their share.  I considered this to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; key element of my retirement, as it diminishes an otherwise significant expense.  Finally, you also can maintain your life / disability insurance at a discount (though most reduce the coverage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and by the way, my wife gets the same benefits (humble brag).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, boom x 2, over $122,000 per year, assuming we both only make $100k as our high-3 salaries (we actually have made more due to occasional warzone compensation and such), and our TSP accounts have been doing much better.  Pretty darned sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fallout 3: The Realities of Living in the DC Wasteland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not all wine and roses (well, there &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wine...and liquor, and beer), but not all roses, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started in the federal government, and not as an FSO, my salary was about $28,000...GS-07 in the early 2000s, for those wondering.

We’ve all served places where our lives are literally on the line...and while I can’t avoid “life”, generally speaking, I do feel safer in the US than in Nicaragua, Russia, or, Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than a decade...that’s the way I see.  I’m doing my job (and then some), but the light at the end of the tunnel...that’s in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.  Feel free to ask almost anything.  I’m happy to add more depth to whatever I touched on, though I will be a little coy about exactly where I served in some instances (dates, in particular), as you can very quickly dox me like this.&lt;/p&gt;

He worked from 7 in the morning to 9 at night, then put in some extra hours at home to keep the house clean and spend time with us every day of the week. I knew we weren't poor, but I knew we weren't wealthy either. So I put in the time and research into creating my own businesses, explored a wide variety of hobbies, made a name for myself in a couple fields, and just this year got into college. There's a high chance that he's reading this post right now (hi dad!)

We got to vacation a lot when I was younger, maybe once a year, and see the world and all these cool places. That led me to apply to a college out of state, and with the general scope of my extracurriculars, I got in. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and it's.. incredibly dry. The more I study it, the less I want to do it. It's really, really, really boring. Even though I've been prepping my whole life to enter this field, confronting the material makes me not want to pursue it at all. 

There are other options on the table, of course -- I've got a year's experience running and managing the graphic design and webfront of a local business, researched stock markets and investments vigorously for the past 5 years, started 3-4 moderately successful cryptocurrency companies when I was younger, worked a year perfecting my pitch at a sales job, experience negotiating sponsorships for businesses, pretty good at Java proper, Javascript, Python, HTML, currently starting a media managing/marketing business, etc. I've got a number of skills without a degree. And so I figured that if I continue to work hard, I'll be able to play hard. All I need to pursue my hobbies (travel, learning foreign languages) is money, right?

When I started college, I got access to this fund for my tuition and expenses while I was in college and it sent my mind reeling. It was.. a lot more money than I had seen in my entire life, and it kind of put things in perspective for me. That was the goal amount I was shooting for 10-20 years from now. I suddenly had all this money on hand, which is what I thought I wanted, but it left me feeling kind of empty. Money didn't have the same 'value' anymore, it was just an object. Then I started thinking.

My dad worked, had a lot of money, had a family and a nice job and a kid and hobbies and friends and a career. But he was still unhappy because, despite the money, the career wasn't his passion. He was unhappy whenever he wasn't working, since it was the norm for him. So I talked to my other family members, who have 'fun' careers, and they said that they enjoyed their jobs but it wasn't their passion. And they were in their 50's/60's. 

The more time I spend getting this degree, the more I realize that it isn't my passion, not at all. I see myself going down the path of the rest of my family, who just grin and bear it, get their salaries and live their life minus the passions that they have. I'm in this weird position that, with my side businesses, I can pursue all these things that I'm 'okay' doing, but aren't my passion. I don't know what my passion is.

My goals are simple: I just want to be able to live in a way that makes me happy, lets me travel around the world with someone I love, and lets me not worry about finances and leaves me with plenty of stories to tell people. I really love talking to people and telling stories, so learning languages has always been a passion of mine. Reading books is also one of my favorite things to do (if they're interesting), and I like to surf and do curious things like jumping off waterfalls. I'd like a career that leaves me with a wealth of life experience and possibly travel, even though that sounds super unrealistic and kind of stupid. 

I have no debts, a fair bit saved in my bank account that I worked for myself despite my age (~$10k) and am using that money to start my business soon. My spending is about $1000 a month on food and physical items. My income varies, but it's around $2500 a month give or take some. I'm not sure what career to choose, what path to take, everything is so confusing right now. I'm not sure what I even like doing, and I've pretty much tried a bunch of paths and enjoyed none of them. I really would like some guidance on finding a career path to support FIRE aspirations in the future. Since you guys are older and wiser, what should I avoid and pursue in having a fulfilling, fun life?

Sorry about the long read, but thanks if you did it!

I'm 31 and employed full time in medicine. While I love the idea of retiring early and doing just fun things I like, I feel that I've acquired lots of good helpful skills and that I should stay working in this field a while. Is part time employment a reasonable thing to do? I do think it would make me happier. Let me know what you think of this plan.


Current salary: 115k. No debt and around 200k in retirement money. Overall savings rate now is 50%. I have not fully embraced a lot of what I could be doing- I eat out a lot, etc. (I think if I had more time because of working less, I could more happily grocery shop and meal plan more instead of eating out, things like that)


I was thinking if I work as a part time employee in the 0.6-0.75 range, meaning about 3 days per week, I can still make around 70k, and if I continue to max out 403b and things, I could maybe even get myself down to the 12% federal tax bracket. It's hard for me to calculate in my head but I think I would be having take home cash of about 40k per year which would probably doable if I try, with my current spending of 3200/month.


I guess it would be a dream come true for an employer to agree to the part time plan I request, but jut wondering what everyone's thoughts are and if anyone has done this.
It's not at all realistic for me to have alternating time of working full time - then time totally off- then full time again. Getting hired at most large hospitals is a 3-4 month credentialing process and it's a PITA and painful.

* Have parents help with meals so we can have cheaper and healthier meals with more time to spend on other more fruitful things, exercising, learning, family time, etc.

My mother raised me for about a year after that, before losing custody because she is mentally unstable. 

My mom is now 54 years old. She hasn’t held a job for longer than a year or two and she always spent every penny as soon as it hit her bank account. These days, she lives with a physically abusive often-unemployed husband, in a dilapidated house he recently inherited from his mother. They scrape by on my mom’s disability checks. 

My maternal grandmother lived in a small apartment with no savings, scraping by on social security until she died of cancer.

My father raised me. Like my mother, he has always been a low wage worker. Making matters worse, we live in a pretty HCOL area. Despite that, he squandered most of the money he earned. He remarried when I was 9. His new wife was also a low wage worker and a big spender. In my final 9 years of childhood, I watched my dad buy a new vehicle, new computers, video games, a new TV, PPV wrestling events, and hundreds of worthless trinkets.

When I became a young adult, not much had changed. My dad bought another brand new car. He continued buying worthless trinkets they set on their shelves to never look at again until it’s time to dust them off once in a while. He began getting hooked on Facebook games with micro transactions. At one point, he confessed to me that he spent over $4,000 on one Facebook game over the course of four or five years.  

Fast forward. My dad is now 51 years old. About five years ago, his wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. A year or two after that, her employer was tired of accommodating her inability to stay on her feet, so she was let go. They went to apply for disability but they were denied. A lawyer began assisting them with the process. About a year ago, his wife needed multiple surgeries due to complications from the MS. Down to one insurance and one job, the medical bills piled up. 

Months ago, he confessed to me that he was going to lose his house to foreclosure and his life was falling apart. I was compassionate. They moved into an apartment and continue to spend money on unnecessary things like fast food and big car payments. He has 70k in retirement. 

Now to me. I was raised watching such frivolous spending, so a budget was pretty much foreign to me. I joined the military out of high school and lived paycheck to paycheck. I got married and bought a house at my duty station about two years before the housing market collapsed. The collapse coincided with my honorable discharge, and I returned to my home state with a house on the market that wasn’t getting any bites. With no savings, I couldn’t afford to lower the price or to keep paying the payments, and I lost the house to foreclosure. 

I began civilian life with a very low paying job, but I used my GI bill to get an undergraduate degree. As graduation neared, I divorced and began dating my best friend I’ve known since childhood. Soon after graduating, I got married and I moved into a townhouse she purchased from her mother years prior. We decided to sell that to move into a small home. That was fine until I landed a new job out of town that paid a little more. 

So, we moved out there while renting out the other house. That was fine until my wife got pregnant and she wanted to live closer to family. So we rented out the second house as well, and bought a house with the in-laws. My MIL became our child’s full-time nanny while we worked. We had to subsidize my MIL’s early retirement because she, too, was terrible with money and had virtually zero dollars in retirement at age 55. 

I landed a job that paid even more. Our two rental properties are older and began having problems, causing us to rack up credit card debt. That’s on top of older debt from remodeling a portion of one of the homes to make it more likely to attract renters. 

Here I am at 31 years of age with about $100k in retirement (between my wife and I) and a -$900k net worth. $48k is a debt consolidation loan that slightly reduced our interest rate. $16k is credit card debt from repairs to get the rentals in selling condition. $11k is a car loan. $3k is another car loan. The rest... three mortgages. 

I posted on here a while back but I had too much shame to admit we actually had TWO rentals with our completely dumpster fire finances. But we took the criticism to heart and we’re selling both rentals, aggressively paying down debt, and then saving for retirement at a savings rate of about 50% ($50,000/yr). We really don’t want to repeat the mistakes of our parents and grandparents, and so we won’t. A little over a year ago, I knew very little about retirement investments. Thanks to FI blogs and this subreddit, I have a very good grasp on the basics. It’s surprisingly simple and I now know the path to retiring wealthy by our early 50s. 

We are making nearly $100k/yr net now. We should be making $20k-40k  from our rental sales, which can knock out a lot of our debt. We expect to have our debt paid off no later than 2020 and potentially before the end of 2019, at which point we can really ramp up our savings. With each raise, we’ll throw more into investments, eventually increasing our savings rate to 60-70%. We will teach our kids the value of saving... and they’ll learn by our example.

I just wanted to share my story of breaking away from the cycle (I haven’t yet but I’m sure on the right track). And I wanted to thank those of you whom I have learned from as I lurk this sub almost every day. Thanks for the learning moments and the laughs, and more importantly, thanks for the tough love in my previous FI post. I’ll give another update in a year or two, perhaps. 

TL;DR - our families never saved a dime as we grew up and neither did their parents . . . We began making the same errors in life but we are finally breaking the cycle thanks in part to this sub and informative FI blogs. 

Edit: Grammar and spelling corrections. 

Edit 2: Daaang. This really blew up. Thanks very much for all the kind words (and the gold). And yes, I screwed up my net worth calculation again. I will remember how to calculate it next time. Always learning. I’m glad some of you can relate with my story. I look forward to telling you all to go fuck yourselves over the coming years. Cheers. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was 5 when my parents divorced. My mother raised me for about a year after that, before losing custody because she is mentally unstable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom is now 54 years old. She hasn’t held a job for longer than a year or two and she always spent every penny as soon as it hit her bank account. These days, she lives with a physically abusive often-unemployed husband, in a dilapidated house he recently inherited from his mother. They scrape by on my mom’s disability checks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My maternal grandmother lived in a small apartment with no savings, scraping by on social security until she died of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father raised me. Like my mother, he has always been a low wage worker. Making matters worse, we live in a pretty HCOL area. Despite that, he squandered most of the money he earned. He remarried when I was 9. His new wife was also a low wage worker and a big spender. In my final 9 years of childhood, I watched my dad buy a new vehicle, new computers, video games, a new TV, PPV wrestling events, and hundreds of worthless trinkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I became a young adult, not much had changed. My dad bought another brand new car. He continued buying worthless trinkets they set on their shelves to never look at again until it’s time to dust them off once in a while. He began getting hooked on Facebook games with micro transactions. At one point, he confessed to me that he spent over $4,000 on one Facebook game over the course of four or five years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward. My dad is now 51 years old. About five years ago, his wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. A year or two after that, her employer was tired of accommodating her inability to stay on her feet, so she was let go. They went to apply for disability but they were denied. A lawyer began assisting them with the process. About a year ago, his wife needed multiple surgeries due to complications from the MS. Down to one insurance and one job, the medical bills piled up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months ago, he confessed to me that he was going to lose his house to foreclosure and his life was falling apart. I was compassionate. They moved into an apartment and continue to spend money on unnecessary things like fast food and big car payments. He has 70k in retirement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to me. I was raised watching such frivolous spending, so a budget was pretty much foreign to me. I joined the military out of high school and lived paycheck to paycheck. I got married and bought a house at my duty station about two years before the housing market collapsed. The collapse coincided with my honorable discharge, and I returned to my home state with a house on the market that wasn’t getting any bites. With no savings, I couldn’t afford to lower the price or to keep paying the payments, and I lost the house to foreclosure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began civilian life with a very low paying job, but I used my GI bill to get an undergraduate degree.

At the moment, we’re considering Greenville SC, Raleigh-Durham NC, St. Petersburg FL, and Loudoun County VA (exurban DC), all of which have bike-friendly bona fides, though they don’t tick every box. Where else should we be looking?

Started from my first job aiming to be able to live a life of financial independence and I feel like im just that bit closer!!!  In another four months, no longer will I be tied to a mortgage!!!

Live in a medium to high cost of living area. I worked full time in a low paying job while did university to keep student loans as low as possible. Was able to finish with only $14k student loans and saved for most of the house deposit at the same time.

Following graduating I was able to get a better paying job, increased income and savings then purchased a really awful house nine years ago in a good area for $399K with a 5% deposit (gamble on the LVR which did add borrowing costs but I was young and they were willing to lend), did extensive renos when the spare cash built up. Rented out rooms until I couldn't live with renters anymore! Extra repayments where I could, tax refunds went straight on the loan etc. Moved out to rent it out fully and house shared for six months.

Purchased a condo with equity from the first property in another suburb for $395k three years ago. 

Married two years ago and husband and combined finances then but he currently stays at home with our son and has been for 12months now for lifestyle reasons. No big deposits or cash saving into the loan were possible with combining incomes.

Two cars between us due to need and no loans outstanding (neither were new cars but are reliable and safe) Paid off the $15k gap between deposit and purchase.

No credit card debt outstanding - used for points programs only for food, petrol etc.

No student loans outstanding

Sold the house this year with a reasonable profit and used it to pay down the loan on the condo.

Along the way one $10k inheritance recieved but otherwise blood, sweat, tears, strict budget and the few financial decisions that swung in my favour! 

In perspective, I have only just cracked $100k gross in wages this last year!

It wasn't all smooth sailing. Bumps in the road happened, holidays, medical bills and an occassional loan to cover unforseen emergencies that emergency savings didn't cover were required and paid down and out as quickly as possible.

Next steps will be a bit slower as we are currently only one income but by Xmas will be mortgage free!!!

So here it is, with as much information as I can give. 

Life Situation: Currently I am a single 24(f). I will be starting graduate school thing month as well as working full time. I live in Washington state. Going to school to be a teacher. 

FIRE Progress: I am absolutely nowhere. I have no idea where to begin but I know my current spending and way of life is not sustainable. I'd really like to get better with my money and eventually have financial Independence. 

Gross Salary/Wages: $37,826

Yearly Savings Amounts: So I have a pension which I am not quite sure what it means. I also contribute to my account each month, yearly it looks like I put in about $1,500 a year of money through my own contributions. I am enrolled in SERS Plan 3. I do not understand this plan I do not understand what I need to do with it. This is something I desperately need help with understanding. 

Other Ordinary Income: Summer employment generally gets me $4k. I also do odd jobs such as babysitting and such and I'd say that adds another $1,500 per year. 

Current expenses: Rent: $730 
Car: $320 
Car Insurance: $140 
Pet Care: $100 
Food: $150 
Gym: $90.00 
Netflix: $13 
Transportation (maintenance, gas, bussing): $75
Medical expenses: $100
Miscellaneous extras take up the rest of my income. I don't save a dime which I would really like to change. 


Assets: Is my car an asset? I have a 2017 Honda Fit. 

Liabilities: 
Car Loan-
        Original amount: $20,269
        Interest rate: 4.24%
        Term: 72 months 
        Loan Payment: $320.15
Student Loans: Currently sitting at $13,115.71 with varying interest rates the highest of the rates is 4.45% lowest is 3.76%. 
I have just accepted $37,098 in student loans for graduate school. $20,500 is at 6.6% and $16,598 is at 7.6%. 
Credit card debt: currently sitting at about 5k due to a bad breakup and it being summer break so I spent a little extravagantly on things that I was eventually going to need. 
        

Specific Question(s): Alright so questions where do I begin? How can I go about setting myself up for my future after grad school? Being a teacher isn't the biggest money generator. Should I be trying to contribute to a Roth? Also, for anyone who might know anything about student loans. I am in a public servant position currently and after 10 years of qualifying payments you can have your loans forgiven. Should I start paying them off now to get a jumpstart on those 10 years? Or if I do that will my grad school loans not be counted in with the forgiveness. Finally, for people who enjoy spending money how did you create and stick to a budget? I am also open to any feedback, I know I have made some pretty poor financial decisions in the last little bit but I'm still young, my credit is good, and I am ready and willing to learn.

&lt;p&gt;Life Situation: Currently I am a single 24(f). I will be starting graduate school thing month as well as working full time. I live in Washington state. Going to school to be a teacher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIRE Progress: I am absolutely nowhere. I have no idea where to begin but I know my current spending and way of life is not sustainable. I&amp;#39;d really like to get better with my money and eventually have financial Independence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gross Salary/Wages: $37,826&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yearly Savings Amounts: So I have a pension which I am not quite sure what it means. I also contribute to my account each month, yearly it looks like I put in about $1,500 a year of money through my own contributions. I am enrolled in SERS Plan 3. I do not understand this plan I do not understand what I need to do with it. This is something I desperately need help with understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Ordinary Income: Summer employment generally gets me $4k. I also do odd jobs such as babysitting and such and I&amp;#39;d say that adds another $1,500 per year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current expenses: Rent: $730 
Car: $320 
Car Insurance: $140 
Pet Care: $100 
Food: $150 
Gym: $90.00 
Netflix: $13 
Transportation (maintenance, gas, bussing): $75
Medical expenses: $100
Miscellaneous extras take up the rest of my income. I don&amp;#39;t save a dime which I would really like to change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assets: Is my car an asset? I have a 2017 Honda Fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liabilities: 
Car Loan-
        Original amount: $20,269
        Interest rate: 4.24%
        Term: 72 months 
        Loan Payment: $320.15
Student Loans: Currently sitting at $13,115.71 with varying interest rates the highest of the rates is 4.45% lowest is 3.76%. 
I have just accepted $37,098 in student loans for graduate school. $20,500 is at 6.6% and $16,598 is at 7.6%. 
Credit card debt: currently sitting at about 5k due to a bad breakup and it being summer break so I spent a little extravagantly on things that I was eventually going to need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific Question(s): Alright so questions where do I begin? How can I go about setting myself up for my future after grad school? Being a teacher isn&amp;#39;t the biggest money generator. Should I be trying to contribute to a Roth? Also, for anyone who might know anything about student loans. I am in a public servant position currently and after 10 years of qualifying payments you can have your loans forgiven. Should I start paying them off now to get a jumpstart on those 10 years? Or if I do that will my grad school loans not be counted in with the forgiveness. Finally, for people who enjoy spending money how did you create and stick to a budget? I am also open to any feedback, I know I have made some pretty poor financial decisions in the last little bit but I&amp;#39;m still young, my credit is good, and I am ready and willing to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I (47) are considering ""leanFIRE'ing"" or more like semiFIRE'ing by summer '19. This year, we have been aggressively putting earnings into retirement accounts: my wife maxed out both a 403(b) and a governmental 457(b), put another $10k into a state pension fund, I'll probably max out my 457(b), and we both did our 2018 tIRA contributions to the max. So we'll have put something like $76,500 into tax-deferred retirement accounts. 

I had also *been* planning (but see below) to put another perhaps $10-20k into an individual 401(k) for my freelance work, which I am just opening this week (the paperwork is pending on their end). 

All told, it could be pushing $97k in tax-deferred contributions this year. 

Sounds good, right? My concern, though, has to do with two issues:

1. Spain, where my wife is from and would not mind moving to, currently has free universal healthcare (that we would qualify for because of her citizenship and my marriage to her). It doesn't cover absolutely everything, but overall it seems like a ""safer"" bet than U.S. Medicare (e.g. if you are in the hospital more than 60 days, you currently pay a $335/day ""coinsurance""; 91 days and up, $670/day). 

2. They tax all retirement account distributions--even Roth. 

Point (1) makes me want to consider moving there, possibly during our senior years, since even though healthcare is supposed to be ""free"" for seniors in the U.S. through Medicare, in reality there are estimates ranging from $2,000 to $14,000/year in costs for older Americans (which we've discussed here and on r/leanfire). Taking even a $2k bite out of our yearly budget means needing another $50-66k in investments (assuming a 3-4% SWR), but a $14k/yr bite would require another $350k saved, which would mean working years longer. 

But point (2) means I could have converted 10 years into Roth ($24k * 10 = $240k) which, in the U.S. would be 100% tax free--and in Spain it would all be taxed at about 25%. In fact, if the RMDs plus Social Security benefits (also fully taxable in Spain) got fairly big, the highest marginal tax rate (if an RMD were over $70k, which, at 7% growth, it would get to eventually) would be, at current rates, 47%.

My decision now is whether to contribute anything to my 2018 solo 401(k). I have $9k ready to go, but just want to make sure I'm not putting it in to save paying 12% on it this year only to someday have to pay 25% on it in Spain. But we don't *know* we would actually move there.

I was also thinking that 20 years of tax deferred compounded growth might somewhat make up for the 25% tax hit at the end? 

Thoughts?

---- 

**EDIT:** I'm not saying my choice is between putting this money into a tax-deferred retirement account vs. putting it into a Roth. I'm saying the choice is between putting it into a tax-deferred retirement account vs. just paying the 12% taxes on it this year and putting it into my brokerage account. See my answer to u/StorkSlayer for the details, but it amounts to the idea that if I pay 12% on it now, I *know* we will never pay taxes on it again (because what's left is our money), whereas if I have to wait until we're 65 and retired in Spain, I know I will pay more (maybe much more) on it. But, of course, we're not sure we will retire in Spain. (I am going to attempt to do some ""math"" regarding this this weekend.)

One of our substantial costs are international flights, in our case from the U.S. to Madrid. Last night, we spent some time on Kayak trying out the same travel dates for candidate airports on the east coast, and found they could vary by as much as about $800/flight--and this was for mostly off-season, from early March to early May. I found that surprising!

My wife ideally takes two trips a year there, and would like me to join her every time if we could. If the difference really is $800/flight on average, that could mean as much as 4 x $800 = $3,200/year more if flying from Location X rather than Location Y each time. That will eat into our yearly budget and on a conservative 3% SWR (at least until we can get less lean, say), that would require an additional $105k in savings. Plus, some areas have many direct flights, whereas other ones have only 1-stop or 2-stop options, which is way less pleasant if you do a transatlantic flight often like this. A good airport for us is a value.

* Health insurance in America for a family with kids easily cost upward of $1500+/mo. (at least that's what my COBRA information is telling me) That adds an unreasonably high monthly expense/cost just because of not having a job -- almost higher than mortgage in some cases.
* I recently went through a period of time not working (paternity leave + between-jobs), and honestly I find the lack of any work a little bit boring. Ideally I work half time of the week, but most jobs like that don't offer health insurance?

Has anyone gathered a list of good barista FIRE jobs? I've never worked in Starbucks and don't know quality of life there, and also don't know how many hours it takes to get health insurance at Starbucks. Also, I don't know if barista FIRE is a phrase that includes many other types of similar jobs, or if it's strictly just a Starbucks barista thing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;New poster, heard of FIRE a while back but got reminded of it by the article that&amp;#39;s going around lately.&lt;/p&gt;

This community has been so awesome and inspiring to watch. I mainly lurk, but am posting today via a throwaway. I’m hoping to get a ‘second set of eyes’ on my wife and I’s situation to see if people have thoughts on how to optimize our situation. While I’ve been interested in FIRE for a while (but ruled it out because I thought we were in too deep with student loans), we are newly committed to it – so we’re at the point of hammering down our expenses (stop eating out, leaning out our expenses however we can, etc).  

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background: My wife and I graduated with $380k student loan debt 10 years ago (270k hers, a pharmacist, and 110k mine – a school counselor). Our initial income was around $170k, and we tried to attack our student loans pretty hard – but just the monthly payments were oppressive, and so we used a debt snowball method so that our monthly finances weren’t so rigid. In 10 years, we’ve paid that down to $219k. We’ve consolidated many of our loans, and there are few ‘easy wins’ left (some consolidated loans are 70k+). We admittedly fell off the track of paying aggressively toward these loans due to some other factors (kids, life).

&amp;#x200B;

Right out of the gate, we bought a 2 family house for $232k with an FHA loan (3% down) which allowed us to live in a 3 bedroom apartment for \~$650 a month – which saved us around 500/month in our area. Over time, we’ve had 3 kids and we moved out of our 2 family (but kept it as a rental) into a bigger house with an in-law apartment ($335k) which we again bought with a low downpayment mortgage. Our in-laws contribute $900/month in rent.

&amp;#x200B;

Just by the numbers, here is where we are at:

&amp;#x200B;

Income and investments

Income from jobs: Me $65k + Her $135k = 200k

Income from rental property (not including in-law): 2350/ month – expenses = 600 month, or 7200 a year.

Investments:

Her

401k: $67k

Me

457: $45k

403b: $15k

Pension: \~$45k contributed – I cannot access this unless I sever employment, and I could not access employer contributions which dwarf my contributions. I am vested at this point.

College savings: $22k between a custodial account, and 3 529s.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt

Student Loans: $219k – various interest rates, mostly 5% or under.  

Real Estate:

2 Family we owe $190k on it (3.25% interest rate). We paid $230k, it is worth around $260k currently.

Current house we owe $307k (4% Interest rate), paid $335k and it is worth around $360k.

Automobile: $10k (we own one car outright, and owe on the other)

Credit Card Debt: $12k (0% until May)

There are some other costs, such as day care and after school programs, that take a small bite out of our budget

&amp;#x200B;

We are at a crossroads with regard to strategy and are interested in others thoughts. We are 35 and are concerned about the amount we’ve saved for retirement – I’m not sure we’d be on pace for a standard retirement, nevermind FIRE.  We’d like to try to fully retire by the time our youngest goes to college – so \~15 years. We’d like to start taking better advantage of our tax advantaged accounts – max her 401k + her employer match, max my 457 (and I get a 6.2% employer match into the 403b because my employer does not pay social security), and possibly max the 403b (though I’m stuck at Edward Jones with that and don’t have access to good funds). If we hit a recession, we might shift back to going hard on the student loans if the \~5% guaranteed gain seemed better than what we could earn from pouring that money into our retirement accounts). I also plan to refinance 2 student loans that are at a 6.7% interest rate, I believe I can get that to 6% fixed through SoFi.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated. Specifically interested in strategy to invest/max our retirement accounts vs. recommitting to aggressively paying down debt. Also curious about thoughts on variable vs. fixed rate student loans, and if we should prioritize one vs. the other. Should I refinance student loans – and if so, should I go with a variable rate that seems lower? Should I be worried about the fees in my 403b account – I think I’m in the lowest cost funds available to me, but they’re still pretty high (.47 I believe) compared to a passively managed index.

Then, you can (mostly) expect to safely withdraw 4% every year to use as your income while the principal will remain unchanged unless a severe economic downturn happens. 

So, some numbers: let's say you're 30, and you want to retire at 70 years old.  You want to live comfortably on about $80k per year, so in the 40 years between now and then, you need to build your portfolio to $2M.  Right?  

Sure, conventional wisdom agrees on that.

But... wait a minute... I don't want to retire on $80k a year.  Not in 2058.  I want to retire on *the equivalent purchasing power* of $80k per year.  Doesn't that require more intricate planning? 

Assuming the average annual inflation rate from the past 100 years or so doesn't change in the next 40, we can expect about 2.95% inflation annually.  So if I want to start withdrawing my money in 2058 with an equivalent purchasing power of 2018's $80k, I'll need to start withdrawing $309,210 the first year.  That means, at a SWR of 4%, when I begin retirement, I'll need to have $7,730,246 in my portfolio.  *Not* $2M.

Then there's the problem of increasing withdrawals to remain at the same purchasing power. 

To remain at the exact same level of comfort, I'll need to withdraw $318,332 in the second year of retirement.  And $327,722 in the third year.  At age 90, I'll be withdrawing about $537,222k.  

If I have $2M to retire on in 2058 and I employ the 4% SWR, I'd be like someone today who's retired on $520k, which nets them a grand total of $20,800 per year to live on.  Fixed.  For the rest of their lives.  Which is poverty.

My point is: it seems that people are vastly underestimating the amount of money they'll need to have because they're not taking the toll of inflation into account. 

Or am I completely missing something?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been reading some literature on financial planning and retirement expectations, and it seems that the overall consensus is that you should put your money into investment vehicles that will yield an average 7% return, and plan to have 25 times your preferred lifestyle&amp;#39;s annual cash outflows in savings by retirement.  Then, you can (mostly) expect to safely withdraw 4% every year to use as your income while the principal will remain unchanged unless a severe economic downturn happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, some numbers: let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re 30, and you want to retire at 70 years old.  You want to live comfortably on about $80k per year, so in the 40 years between now and then, you need to build your portfolio to $2M.  Right?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, conventional wisdom agrees on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... wait a minute... I don&amp;#39;t want to retire on $80k a year.  Not in 2058.  I want to retire on &lt;em&gt;the equivalent purchasing power&lt;/em&gt; of $80k per year.  Doesn&amp;#39;t that require more intricate planning? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the average annual inflation rate from the past 100 years or so doesn&amp;#39;t change in the next 40, we can expect about 2.95% inflation annually.  So if I want to start withdrawing my money in 2058 with an equivalent purchasing power of 2018&amp;#39;s $80k, I&amp;#39;ll need to start withdrawing $309,210 the first year.  That means, at a SWR of 4%, when I begin retirement, I&amp;#39;ll need to have $7,730,246 in my portfolio.  &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; $2M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the problem of increasing withdrawals to remain at the same purchasing power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remain at the exact same level of comfort, I&amp;#39;ll need to withdraw $318,332 in the second year of retirement.  And $327,722 in the third year.  At age 90, I&amp;#39;ll be withdrawing about $537,222k.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have $2M to retire on in 2058 and I employ the 4% SWR, I&amp;#39;d be like someone today who&amp;#39;s retired on $520k, which nets them a grand total of $20,800 per year to live on.  Fixed.  For the rest of their lives.  Which is poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is: it seems that people are vastly underestimating the amount of money they&amp;#39;ll need to have because they&amp;#39;re not taking the toll of inflation into account. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently 19 and I would love to get started on this path. My main question is what's the best way to start besides 401K and Roth IRA if you have little to no expenses? (More down below).

What other ways could you put your money to work? Is investing in the stock market risky?

**Debt**

My current debt is $11,400 ($6800 in car loan). I currently only pay interest on my car (6.25%), the other credit cards have promotional no interest that will be paid off before interest starts. I don't have any plans of taking student loans.

**Income**

I have full time class and a full time job making around $32,000 / yr. I also get around $6,000 - $8,000 in scholarship refunds a year. I have around $3000 in my 401K that I started when I turned 18 with a company 3% match and 50% @ 3-5%. I currently contribute 6% per paycheck (bi weekly). I have an emergency fund of $5,000 as well.

**Expenses**

Currently I only have $315 / month of bills (car insurance, phone, etc). I don't pay rent (live with parents). I dedicate around $800 - $1000 / month in paying off my debt and use some of my scholarship money to pay it off faster as well. The rest is used for savings, gas, etc. I could try to increase my saving percent or debt payment.

According to my snowball spreadsheet I will be debt free anywhere between August 2019 - September 2019. After which I will start dedicating 15% of my monthly income to a Roth IRA and potentially increase my 401K contribution to 10% per paycheck.

My main concern is that am I going about this correctly? Is becoming FIRE just saving income, 401k, Roth IRA? What other ways can I utilize my spare income?

It's surprising just how small the bear markets are relative to both the length and returns of the bull markets. I would have guessed a ratio of 70% bull to 30% bear, but it's more like 90% bull to 10% bear. A good reminder about how the media's natural pessimism can alter our thinking about market performance, and about the value of buy-and-hold.

Throwaway account. We hit 4M NW today!  

44 years old. Married with 2 kids (age 7/8) . Dual Income (650K + 160 k ). My salary is expected to reduce as I get older and lazier. We’re both doctors.  (With changes in US healthcare, I wouldn't be surprised if my income dropped by 50% within 5 years). No health issues for anyone yet. Kids in public school, but expect to do private HS for both (\~25k/yr per kid at that time). I expect to pay for my kids college and possibly grad school. 

House: Mortgage 100k left (@2.25% ; (Conservative value=925k) . I haven't payed it off completely b/c Int rate is low. Wife wants to pay it off for psychological reasons. 

Investable assets:

\- Retirement:  840K

\- Taxable: 1.4M vanguard + 620K in stocks (Schwab Accnt; Tech heavy)

\- Realty Shares: 30K

\- Cash 110K

529: 93K

2 Cars owned: 70K.  

Credit card debt: low; 2K at this time

Student loans: paid off completely. 

Ownership of business: not added; b/c its unclear and I’m not counting on these funds.

Annual expenses: on my to do list (but I’m scared); I’m ball parking around 100K excluding mortgage.

I know I’m doing well overall but I can’t reveal these details to people I know. I’ve spoken to my friends about FIRE, but now realize that that’s the wrong thing to do. It seems too humblebraggy. I've enjoyed lurking on this subreddit.

I am 35 in the Midwest with income around 45k.  I've always liked condos because of the financial benefit of owning without exterior upkeep such as lawn care and snow removal.

Currently I own 3 condos all paid off.  I bought the first one when I was 20.  The average condo fee is 130/month.  Property taxes work out to be about 70/month.  I also have a product called landlord condo insurance on the two I rent out.  The insurance works out to be about 16/month.

I am getting 795/month rent on each.  So my monthly profit works out to be 1148.  My personal reoccurring fixed expenses figured monthly are 130 condo fee, 70 property tax, 100 energy bill, 40 internet, 50 phone, 16 property insurance and 10 netflix.  For a total of 416.  Food and entertainment is around 700 excluding any large non reoccurring expenses per month.  Reoccurring + average food and entertainment  = 1116.

In about 8 months I will be buying another one all cash.  This will bring my monthly profit up to around 1722.  In 2020 I will rent out the one I'm currently living in and move into another one using about 75% debt.  This will bring my monthly profit to around 2296.  At that point I will try to find a part-time job with health benefits to work 4 or so hours in the morning.  Then get my real-estate license for some other side income.

My SO and I make \~250k combined and already max out both of our 401ks.

Our salary probably won't change significantly from where we are at right now.

We're both around 30 years old. We have a total of 100k combined in our 401ks, and \~40k in Roth IRAs. I opened a 429 with 4k. We have no property or debt.

I am possibly saving for a house in the future, and I already have almost a 100k in liquid assets in a high interest bank account. This probably isn't quite a 20% downpayment on something I want to get, but I don't think I'll be purchasing anything in the next 2 years.

Anyway, my main question is, should we do a backdoor roth IRA?   
Are there any drawbacks? As I mentioned, our salary probably won't increase much from where we are.

My thinking is that I mine as well pay taxes now and get 30+ years of tax free growth. Is there a different angle to think about my situation?

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my main question is, should we do a backdoor roth IRA?&lt;br/&gt;
Are there any drawbacks? As I mentioned, our salary probably won&amp;#39;t increase much from where we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thinking is that I mine as well pay taxes now and get 30+ years of tax free growth. Is there a different angle to think about my situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!  &lt;/p&gt;

**Long story short, I am ready and will FIRE at 34. But I'm considering taking a ""bullshit"" or stress-free job for personal reasons and benefits. If you want a little background of my story, please read on. If not, please go straight to the points that I have highlighted in bold below. Would love to hear your opinion/view on my choices.**

I am 34, M, single with no kids, and will ""FIRE"" in 3 months. I sat down with my boss this morning and told him why and when. After a bit of going back and forth, he was totally cool with it and thanked me for giving him 3 months instead of the typical two-week notice.

Sorry, but no FIRE unicorn here. I worked in the tech field and made well over six figures for the majority of my career. I lived pretty frugally throughout my life and dumped most of my income into the stock market. As of today, my main brokerage account hovers at around 1M (actually just dipped below 1M because of today's market lol), a little under 100k in 401k, and 35k in a Roth IRA. A vast majority of my holdings in my main brokerage account are S&amp;P 500 ETF and blue chip stocks (VOO, BRK.B, AMZN, MSFT, APPL, GOOG, NVDA, WMT, WM, T, etc. for those who care/want to know), and a small portion in more risky stocks. Both my 401k and Roth IRA are pretty much just S&amp;P 500 ETFs.

I know this amount might not be enough for some, but for me it is. At least for now. As mentioned, I have been pretty frugal throughout my life, mainly due to the fact that I grew up in a very poor household. I still remember the days when my parents came into my room to ask for my Christmas and birthday monies that our relatives gave me in order to pay for our rent. Fortunately, those days didn't last too long. My family wasn't rich or well-off per say by the time I got to high school but we lived okay for the most part. Anyway, before I go off on a tangent, basically I just want to say that that lifestyle never left me and I actually enjoy it. My FIRE budget will be at around 30k per year including taxes/fees/whatever there might be. Of course, this number will differ a little every year but my goal is to aim at around 30k every year.  Definitely not losing sleep over a few grands above my target.

My plan for the living situation is to move from NYC to south Florida, not sure which city yet but most likely somewhere near Miami (by near I mean 1-2 hour drive, and that can get you pretty far for you big city folks). The main reasons why I'm choosing Florida are because low cost of living and state-tax free. In NYC, let alone having a state tax, we have something called the city tax... Can't and shouldn't complain tho. If it wasn't for NYC, chances are I would not have been able to FIRE at this age. Anyhow, I have lived in Florida before and love it there, so it wasn't like I solely picked it because it was cheaper to live in. I know what I'm getting into and I know what my lifestyle will be like there. And here are my main break down of the living costs:

Rent &amp; Utils: $15000~

*As a New Yorker, housings are dirt cheap in Florida. Enough said.*

Gas, car insurance &amp; maintenance: $1500~

*I own a 2014 Camry, fully paid off. Very little mileage (I live in NYC after all). So I'm giving myself a decent size cushion for insurance and maintenance fees here.*

Food: $5000~

*I cook a lot, one of the reasons is being frugal. Again, I'm giving myself a huge cushion here. I have been cooking for myself for almost two decades, I know how to portion my sizes to make more meals and hunt for good deals at the groceries. Thus, I'm going to skip toiletry and cleaning products in the COL because I definitely won't be needing 5k a year for food alone, I will just treat them as part of the grocery shopping bill.*

Entertainment: $1000~

*This is the part where most of you guys will start to dislike me. I know, I'm not a good person but it is what it is. I download and stream all my movies, shows, and music illegally. The only time showbiz can make a dime out of me is when I go to the movie theaters, which I rarely go to. I might go there 2 or 3 times per year. Maybe when I FIRE'd I will go more often but who knows. I suppose most of that $1000 will go toward my cellphone bill and Internet. Most if not all of my hobbies are free and/or low cost. I'm into cooking, swimming, hiking, running, kayaking, working out, browsing Reddit, watching movies, TV, sports, music (all free as I mentioned), etc.*

Travel: $2000-3000~

*Who doesn't love to travel right? Well, I do for the most part but not constantly. My goal is 1 international trip and 1 domestic trip every year. Sometimes maybe even just 1 domestic or 1 international, not both. Contrary to popular opinion, I wouldn't want to travel 24/7 even if I had the money. Traveling is exhausting in my opinion, I rather take my time and see more things per location than just ""to go there"" just to tell people that I went to all these places.*

Misc &amp; Eating out, etc: $500~

*I rarely eat out. Mostly with friends. Even then I would pick the medium-priced items. Though this number can/might shoot up if I end up in a relationship. As boring as I sound, I do find going on restaurant dates very romantic and fun.*

That ultimately puts me at around $25000~26000 per year against my yearly income of $25500. I simply did $30000*.85 = $25500 to include the taxes/fees. Once again, some year I might live on less and some might be more, $30k is just a goal or guideline for myself. And hey, not so fast just yet, I left out one important cost that most people tend to forget about, health insurance. Which is one of the main reasons why I want to keep ""working."" 

Main reasons why I want to keep working (at a bullshit job):

**1. Ironically, it gives me a sense of life.**

This is probably the part where some of you guys will hit the backspace or close the tab, but hear me out. ""Getting out of the rat race"" is just a blanket term. This statement should be put into a form of a question, *why do you want to get out of the rat race?* For me, social anxiety plays a huge part. While my job does provide me with a good paycheck, I suffer a lot of peer pressure from upper management and people on my team. Sitting at my computer desk at 11:30pm on a Sunday evening is one the worst feelings ever, I bet you guys can agree with me on this one. It's not only the fact that I have to get up 7 in the morning and try to catch the fully packed train, but the fact that I have a boss to answer to and people to manage the moment I step inside the office. I hide it quite well, but I often panicked in front of my subordinates and my managers. Basically running all these bad thoughts and judgements inside my head. As hideous as it sounds, if money wasn't a problem, I don't mind being the lowest guy on the totem pole at work. Nobody will judge me if I screw up the most simple thing and nobody will expect me to lead them, it's 100% stress free. Being able to drive and always have a parking spot in front of the building is also a great perk as oppose to catching a packed train with grumpy commuters (Florida can definitely provide that).

I know I'm not a great writer and this isn't a good thread for a guide or anything, but if you can get anything out of this thread, make sure you test the water first before FIREing out of nowhere just because you have reached your net worth goal. Take a small sip of the hot soup first before taking a mouthful so you don't burn your tongue. Yeah, the soup is delicious but it is also freaking hot and it needs to be cooled down first. So that's exactly what I did. I purposely took 2 weeks off work with nothing scheduled ahead (no traveling, no planning stuff with family/friends ahead of time, etc.) just to get a sense of what my FIRE life would be like. The first day was amazing, I think I woke up at like 1pm and then made myself brunch. Sat around, dicked around on my PC, and that was it. Second day, repeat. Third day, I got bored and decide to hit up my friends, oh wait it was a Wed, everybody had work. So I went to the movies by myself. Fourth day, you guessed it, I got pretty bored but still enjoying the no-work life. Fifth day, I actually want to go back to work and speak with my coworkers and see some familiar faces. I mean it wasn't like, ""shit, I'm dying over here, I need to be back at work ASAP. I made a huge mistake!"" It was just that the thought suddenly crossed my mind and that I was bored out of my mind. Next two days were okay because I finally got to hang out with my friends and family. The following week was straight up, ""what the fuck am I doing with my life?"" I don't want to make it sound like it was hell and that I was suffering or anything, but I can totally see myself not being happy over time and may even fall into a depression in the long run. I really sat down and thought about it, it won't be weeks or months, but years of this. I think finding a motive in life is very important. Again, as ironic as it sounds, I think a 9-5 stress-free work schedule might just keep me sane. Of course, this is what I think will work for me. I'm not saying it's right or it's wrong. Just find what works best for yourself.

And as bad as it sounds (you gotta plan for the worst right?), what if you really didn't enjoy FIRE and want to go back to your old job? It might just be a little too late by then.

**2. Health Insurance**

This is a big one. I wonder if many of you FIRE'd people are running into the same problem. I care about my health a lot and would want to continue to go to the dentist twice a year and my physical once a year even after I FIRE'd. But health insurance is so freaking expensive without employer's help so I don't know anymore. If I can land a *bullshit* job where they can relief some of those insurance payments, I would definitely start working again.

**3. 401k**

I think this one is pretty self-explanatory. I want to continue to invest even after I FIRE'd, and one of the best investing vehicles is the 401k as it provides many tax advantages. And this goes back to my point that ""my 1M net work might not be enough for some, but for me it is, *for now*."" I see 401k as my ultimately safety net for the times I really can't work anymore. I want to continue to beef up this account, if possible. 

**4. Resume, beer money, socialize**

Continuing from the third point, what if 1M really won't last me and I will have to go back to work before my 401k and social security kick in. I don't see how not having a X amount of year gap of work will hurt me if I were to go back into the rat race. In fact, I can probably use it to show that I never really left the workforce on my resume during the job hunt. Either way, it will look better than having a huge gap of no work experience for sure. 

And of course, having few extra bucks won't hurt. Plus, meeting new people and chatting with coworkers is always fun. Lastly, everything is still up in the air for the rest of my life. I'm still single and unsure if I will have kids. I might just need that extra dough and/or going back to work in case a kid or two pop out.

Anyway, *bullshit jobs* are basically what I'm only willing to apply to and/or work for again (for now). I am thinking of some simple office job where I just do some photocopying, typing up emails, updating data, etc. Dick around for 5, work for 3, and then go home. I also thought about being a security guard. Would love to hear some suggestions on bullshit jobs to apply for. Pay is basically out of the equation for me, as long as I don't have much to do and have decent benefits, I will even take a minimum wage job if needed. And most importantly, what do you guys think of my plan of continuing working (at a bullshit job)?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advanced for the click-baitish title!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long story short, I am ready and will FIRE at 34. But I&amp;#39;m considering taking a &amp;quot;bullshit&amp;quot; or stress-free job for personal reasons and benefits.

I really sat down and thought about it, it won&amp;#39;t be weeks or months, but years of this. I think finding a motive in life is very important. Again, as ironic as it sounds, I think a 9-5 stress-free work schedule might just keep me sane. Of course, this is what I think will work for me. I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s right or it&amp;#39;s wrong. Just find what works best for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as bad as it sounds (you gotta plan for the worst right?), what if you really didn&amp;#39;t enjoy FIRE and want to go back to your old job? It might just be a little too late by then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Health Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big one. I wonder if many of you FIRE&amp;#39;d people are running into the same problem. I care about my health a lot and would want to continue to go to the dentist twice a year and my physical once a year even after I FIRE&amp;#39;d. But health insurance is so freaking expensive without employer&amp;#39;s help so I don&amp;#39;t know anymore. If I can land a &lt;em&gt;bullshit&lt;/em&gt; job where they can relief some of those insurance payments, I would definitely start working again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. 401k&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this one is pretty self-explanatory. I want to continue to invest even after I FIRE&amp;#39;d, and one of the best investing vehicles is the 401k as it provides many tax advantages. And this goes back to my point that &amp;quot;my 1M net work might not be enough for some, but for me it is, &lt;em&gt;for now&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; I see 401k as my ultimately safety net for the times I really can&amp;#39;t work anymore. I want to continue to beef up this account, if possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Resume, beer money, socialize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the third point, what if 1M really won&amp;#39;t last me and I will have to go back to work before my 401k and social security kick in. I don&amp;#39;t see how not having a X amount of year gap of work will hurt me if I were to go back into the rat race. In fact, I can probably use it to show that I never really left the workforce on my resume during the job hunt. Either way, it will look better than having a huge gap of no work experience for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, having few extra bucks won&amp;#39;t hurt. Plus, meeting new people and chatting with coworkers is always fun. Lastly, everything is still up in the air for the rest of my life. I&amp;#39;m still single and unsure if I will have kids. I might just need that extra dough and/or going back to work in case a kid or two pop out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;em&gt;bullshit jobs&lt;/em&gt; are basically what I&amp;#39;m only willing to apply to and/or work for again (for now). I am thinking of some simple office job where I just do some photocopying, typing up emails, updating data, etc. Dick around for 5, work for 3, and then go home. I also thought about being a security guard. Would love to hear some suggestions on bullshit jobs to apply for. Pay is basically out of the equation for me, as long as I don&amp;#39;t have much to do and have decent benefits, I will even take a minimum wage job if needed. And most importantly, what do you guys think of my plan of continuing working (at a bullshit job)?&lt;/p&gt;

Vanguard predicts [edit: increased risk of] recession by late 2020 and shrewd investors should be pulling out of stocks and into bonds sooner rather than later to better weather the impending correction. The article suggests a 50% bond portfolio would have returned to its original value about three times faster than an all-stock one in the last recession.

Is your investment horizon long enough that this next correction will just be a yard sale for stock?

I'm a little torn myself. I'm at less than 5% bonds at an age when Vanguard suggests 15%.

Edit: I didn’t open the spreadsheet before I posted the article and I didn’t realize that it was above the actual income. What I did find interesting about the article and somethings I’ve always wondered about is that spending in retirement might be higher than what I spend now (less child care and savings). Sure I may not have a mortgage (but I might) and I might not be paying for childcare, but it’s really hard to account for health care. I feel like in the future it will be about the same as mortgage or child care. We don’t eat out much and my cooking is pretty much on the low end, so it would be hard for that to go down. It can only go up because of less free food/coffee at work.   

Honestly, the closest example I can think of to this is I thought I would save $2000/mo on child care when my kids are out of daycare and in school, but when I did the math, it was closer to $1000 once I factor in before and after care as well as summer care.  Less than $2000, but not zero, actually quite substantial. 

I’m not entirely sure how they arrived at those numbers, most of them are on the higher end, however there maybe little luxuries in all of our lives we don’t account.  Cars for example, the average cost of ownership is $725/mo based on AAA, and extra $200/mo will get you a slightly higher model than national average if you factor in higher depreciation, higher maintenance cost, insurance and lower fuel economy.  Perhaps not everyone pays that much monthly for their cars, but it’s not a crazy, out of this world number. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article from WSJ today.

I'm just starting to dabble in the world of FIRE. I read Mr. Money Mustache's blog post on how to calculate savings rate but it left me with one question: How do I factor in money that I'm saving but not investing into my savings rate?

Balance Billing is a U.S. phenomenon in which medical providers can bill you essentially whatever they wish if you are not part of their network.

I'm writing this post because I'm struggling with a tough decision: whether to buy a place in my HCOL area, or keep living in my rent-controlled apartment.

I'm 32, live in the U.S., and moved to my HCOL area when I was fresh out of college in 2008. Back then, it was still pricey, but nothing like it is today, so my 1BR apartment in a crummy neighborhood cost $1100/month. 10 years later, I still live there — and while the neighborhood is still crummy, rent control has meant that the $1100/month price hasn't changed since the day I signed the lease. (Technically, my landlord is legally allowed to raise the rent by a certain percentage each year, and had he done that, it would be more like $1250/month now. But he hasn't done so and I'm certainly not going to ask why!)

Though I don't make a very high salary for the area at my W-2 job (about $85K/year), I also make an extra $15-20K/year in 1099 side income, and I've been an assiduous saver/investor since I started working. Thanks to getting in at the bottom of the market, I now have a decent nest egg. I've got about $120K in cash savings for emergency fund/down payment, $110K in a brokerage account, and $145K in my Roth and 401(k); total net worth is about $375K. My target is to FIRE in my early 50s, later than a lot of folks here but not bad for someone who makes as little as I do and lives in an area this pricey.

In most other places in the country, I'd be a prime candidate for homeownership. But in my area, even a modest one-or-two-bedroom single-family home is about $800-900K, and one-bedroom condos are $650-700K, with high HOA fees. Moving isn't a good option, because I work in a niche industry that more or less exclusively operates out of the country's priciest metros; anywhere else I can do my job has housing that's pretty much just as expensive.

So I've just stayed in my apartment as the years have gone by and home prices in my area have skyrocketed. Now, I'm on the verge of being priced out of the housing market altogether—just as I'm looking to take the next step with my boyfriend by moving in together. My boyfriend, who works in the same niche industry, makes a little less than me ($60K) and has no debt but only modest savings ($9K in cash, $6K in retirement). So the down payment would be pretty much entirely on me, although he'll pay his share of a mortgage.

Targeting 33% of our combined W-2 income (not counting my side gigs) for housing costs, we've determined that we can spend up to $800K on a house (\~$4,000/month for mortgage/taxes/insurance). We've gotten preapproved for a $600K mortgage, and I could liquidate my brokerage account, put $200K down and still have enough cash left over for closing costs and a small emergency fund. But then that's basically all of my non-retirement savings locked up in one very pricey asset. And the likelihood that my salary will go up much in the future isn't very strong (I'm in a niche that a lot of people want to work in, which drives pay down, and I'm sure you've all seen the reports that wage growth is pretty much nonexistent even in this hot economy).

Of course, the alternative is that my boyfriend could (with difficulty, and probably hiring a tenant lawyer) move into my apartment. Even if my landlord raises the rent to the allowed increases, we could easily afford it. And we don't want kids, which means we could stay here basically in perpetuity.

But as nice as the cheap rent is, I'm getting tired of living in this apartment after 10 long years. The neighborhood has a lot of homelessness and street crime. I live in a street-facing unit on a busy, noisy street, with loud and obnoxious homeless people yelling at all hours and loud upstairs neighbors who drive me nuts (and who predate me in the building and aren't going anywhere). The apartment is small enough that it would be tight for two people, and has no outdoor space and no nearby parks. My boyfriend has a car, but street parking here is impossible and a garage space is $325/month. I love to cook, but my oven doesn't work (stovetop only). I don't have in-building laundry, and the last laundromat in the neighborhood just closed. There are a lot of reasons why living here isn't fun, cheap rent or no.

I really want to live somewhere nicer, quieter, maybe with a backyard. But getting a new rental at market rate doesn't make a lot of sense—a 1BR rental with those kinds of amenities here is probably $3000+/month now.

So should I buy and put all of my cash into a house, or should I continue to stay put, keep my money in the market and appreciate my golden handcuffs, even if it means that I'm not super happy with a lot of the aspects of my day-to-day life?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi FIRE folks, I&amp;#39;m mostly a lurker but have learned so much from y&amp;#39;all.

Long time lurker and fire amateur here. Mid 30s and married with a kid. I am an entrepreneur and have never had a real job. Today I own small but growing tech companies. They are self sustaining, have value and provide a lot of good jobs.

I am starting to build a model for financial Independence. A lot of what I read about involves a lot of saving. I have a few issues with traditional fire philosophies that maybe people can share thoughts on. 

1. Saving is tough for me because being in business for myself I basically want to throw every dollar of extra cash at my own ventures. I used to save and have money in the markets but around 2008 the money just shrank and returns were garbage. I did the math and can generate a better return putting 100k in my own ventures then the market. Traditional fire philosophy seems to be to save 50% because it will generate X returns in index funds. If my own ventures grow in value faster than the index funds.... how can I ever take money and diversify? My own ventures are growing 10-20% value every year. Another problem I have is 90% of my wealth is in my ventures. 9% real estate. And 1% stocks 401ks. I know I need to diversify but it’s tough to take money from stuff growing at 10-20% a year and put it into stuff growing less. (Even during the Great Recession. And rate of growth seems to be going up as I get really good and scientific with my venture.) But if all my ventures collapse I have very little left it’s scary. 

2. This probably goes against FIRE but I am used to a good lifestyle. The first 10 years of my career I paid myself very little and starved. Always reinvested and paid my people first. Then about 5 years ago I decided to start paying myself a lot more to generate a bigger drive. It worked. So for working 80+ hours a week I reward myself with a great life and lots of experiences. If I go full fire and save 50% of my paycheck my lifestyle will really take a hit. It’s tough to work like 80+ hours and live very meager.  

3. Besides spending on lifestyle I have a problem where I have immigrant parents and inlaws that went through hell to give me and my wife a good life. Great Recession and health problems wiped their shot for any normal retirement so multiple people beyond my wife and kids depend on me. Dad has chronic cancer. Mom laid off at 64 and couldn’t find no work no matter how hard we tried. It’s easier to say I can save a ton if I don’t have relatives that I need to support. How do fire people deal with that. Let the relatives go to the edge of starvation and misery so they can save?

4. If I go full fire and dramatically reduce my lifestyle, my worry is if something happens. Like get into an accident or have a random big medical thing and I never get to enjoy it. It’s tough to take from my experiences today to maybe have a better retirement someday and not have to work. What happens if I never get to enjoy it. 

5. My other problem is my job is also my hobby. I do deal with stress but I really enjoy work. But I would love to not need to work and can scale back involvement. I still “need” to work. If I stop working it all collapses. So that is also a little different than traditional FIRE situations where people want to not work their main careers. 

6. With 90% of my assets in my own ventures.... are there any words of wisdom about portfolio allocations. I don’t think I can ever get to a normal fire distribution. My ultimate fire goal I believe is 20mil in assets. I live in a major metro area and grew up in big cities and would get bored in a small city. But if 90% of the 20mil is my own ventures that is not wise. So any words of wisdom on people achieving fire that are heavy in their own ventures. 


Just any words of wisdom to help would be great. 

Thank you all for making this community. It’s really cool. Once I figure out my own fire planning I plan to create paths for my own team members to achieve it too. 

They should teach this stuff in school.

Hello everyone,

I’m looking for some criticism of my current AA. I would like to retire in about 6 years and would need a SWR of 4% from my Vanguard investments. I need to work another 3 years for my employer so that I become “vested” in our pension program. My pension would be 40% of highest gross earnings in a year at 55yo or 60% at 62yo. In other words, I could withdraw $40k a year @55yo or $60k @ 62yo. I will be 40 when I retire and plan to pursue a passion of mine which will most likely garner some income but I don’t want to factor that in to the equation. I will be moving to Puerto Rico and plan to take advantage of Act 22 which “Seeks to attract new residents to Puerto Rico by providing a total exemption from Puerto Rico income taxes on all passive income realized or accrued after such individuals become bona fide residents of Puerto Rico.” Act 22 provides 100% exemption on all interest and dividend incomes, 100% exemption on all capital gains, and a 4% corporate tax rate.

So here I am posting to Reddit.

The details:

Working as a chemical engineer overseas earning in the low 200s, although taxes are in the 40% range. Able to save 80% of my after tax income to be able to FIRE at 40 with 1 kid budgeted (currently 0). Aiming for 2M with a SWR of 3.5% for annual income of 70k.

All savings are invested passively. RRSP and TFSA are maxed out first and then the remainder into an unregistered investment account. I tend to favour Canadian bank stocks as they have an excellent track record. They've never cut their dividend and pay an average of 4%. I'm not well diversified here because of this but have averaged about 11-12% over the last 5 years. 

Real estate is a bit of a shit show in Canadian cities so I'm looking for lower CoL cities that don't put me in -40 winters (spoiler: there aren't many). So I'm keeping that 500k liquid and invested, which is working well so far.

Thanks for reading. Its finally nice to be able to share this information even if it's more brag than humble. I really enjoy seeing people meet their goals and go fuck themselves!

EDIT:  thanks everyone for reading and all the positive feedback. To answer some questions:

Yes this is a high salary for someone in my field. The best advice I can give for anyone young is to not be put off by experience requirements for a job. My salary went from 75k to 156k to 216k in 5 years simply by aiming high (and of course being able to deliver when I got there). They say the best time to look for a job is when you still have one, so I'm always looking for the next big opportunity.  This also applies to asking out the pretties girl/guy and so many other things. Worst case scenario is you're in the same place you were 5 minutes ago. Big risks = big rewards. (Disclaimer: logic, common sense, due diligence may be required)

I work in the Latin America region, not the Middle East, so I've been looking at going non resident for now in a place like Panama, Costa Rica, Belize, or Ecuador. Panama especially seems like a great place to relocate to. 

My savings rate is high because my CoL is covered at work so I don't spend any money at all. I don't rent an apartment but travel exclusively when I'm off work. My girlfriend lives in Europe so I visit her frequently and travel to other low CoL sunny countries in other months. This has proven to be a cheaper lifestyle than when I was a student in Vancouver just spending the baseline (rent, car insurance, phone bill, etc). One of the perks of my job is that when I finish work, I get a free RT airfare to almost anywhere in the world....so I make sure to take advantage. Avoiding lifestyle creep is everything with FIRE, but I make sure to budget in such a way that I enjoy my life and lead a meaningful life until I reach my goals.

This has proven to be a cheaper lifestyle than when I was a student in Vancouver just spending the baseline (rent, car insurance, phone bill, etc). One of the perks of my job is that when I finish work, I get a free RT airfare to almost anywhere in the world....so I make sure to take advantage. Avoiding lifestyle creep is everything with FIRE, but I make sure to budget in such a way that I enjoy my life and lead a meaningful life until I reach my goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again everyone for reading and responding. I&amp;#39;m very happy to receive such positive feedback. Good luck with your respective FI goals!&lt;/p&gt;

Here is why I do not believe the 4% rule is likely to apply:

1. The portfolio composition in the study assumes a constant 50% stock and 50% bond asset allocation.

2. The time horizon is 30 years. Isn't this the retire early forum where many of us will retire between 45 and 55? 

3. It is a rigid rule that assumes no change in real spending. Have you considered inflation?

4. Future market returns may not follow the same pattern as past market returns, even if you back test 100 years.

5. There is a high degree of confidence of not running out of money

I think some assumptions need to be made that make a simple ""4% safe withdrawal"" rule of thumb impossible.

My company did an analysis (and without considering mortality) with the following assumptions and did a Monte Carlo Analysis. 1 different trial of 2,500 draws each were run for different confidence intervals, time horizons, and asset allocations:

-Withdrawals increase by a constant 2.31% rate of inflation.

-Portfolio level nominal returns and standard deviations are (respectively):

-Conservative (4.8%, 3.5%)

-Moderate Conservative (6.2%, 6.5%)

-Moderate (7.2%, 9.6%)

-Moderate Aggressive (8.0%, 12.3%)

A conservative asset allocation is 15% large cap, 0% small equity, 5% international equity, 50% fixed income, and 30% cash investments

A moderate conservative asset allocation is 25% large cap, 5% small equity, 10% international equity, 50% fixed income, and 10% cash investments

A moderate asset allocation is 35% large cap, 10% small equity, 15% international equity, 35% fixed income, and 5% cash investments

A moderate aggressive allocation is 45% large cap, 15% small equity, 20% international equity, 15% fixed income, and 5% cash investments

What they found was that at a 90% confidence interval (i.e. the % of time where the ending balance was greater than $0) was:

3.5% for the conservative allocation, 3.6% for the moderate conservative allocation, 3.6% for the moderate allocation, and 3.4% for the moderate aggressive. 

They found that at the 75% confidence level (75% of the time the ending balance will be &gt; 0) that:

The conservative portfolio had a 3.7% withdrawal, the moderate conservative portfolio had 4.0% withdrawal, the moderate portfolio had a 4.2% withdrawal rate, and the moderate aggressive portfolio had a 4.2% withdrawal rate.

My point is that you can't just assume 4.0% will last 30 years. My company found that at a 90% confidence level, that 3.6% was a safe withdrawal rate for someone with a moderate conservative or moderate portfolio. A conservative portfolio is down to 3.5% and an aggressive portfolio is down to 3.4%.

And there is still the 10% of the time that the balance was less than $0 before the end of the 30 years.

They found that a ~4% withdrawal rate only had a 75% confidence interval. Do you like those odds?

So for this reason, I would not say to myself, ""All I need to do is reach a $2,000,000 balance and then I can withdraw $80,000 for the next 30 years and not run out of money.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work as a retirement actuary in DB (pension) and DC (401k) plans.

I say this in part in jest as I know the two are not mutually exclusive but it really does feel that way sometimes.  

Some time in the last couple of years I crossed LeanFI levels and have been working towards 'current lifestyle FI' (as I called it) or possibly even FatFIRE.  My profession is a high intensity extreme travel type life, I've been on the road 250+ days/year for 16 years and my original goal was to get out of this by divorcing myself from the need for income and then find things to occupy my time. 

However, I've always been a 'car guy' and it was the one area where I've splurged a bit though always in modest proportions.  For example, about 18 months ago it was time to retire my '03 Cobra for another daily driver, I settled on a low miles '10 Jaguar XKR where at $28k I thought the $ value/fun ratio was well in my favor and generally didn't disrupt my overall savings to any noticeable degree by paying cash for it.  I also was hoping that buying the 'poor mans Aston' would satiate my desire for the real thing.  

It did not.  

I'm coming up to my 40'th and felt like I should do something to mark it and indulge a bit.  I've wanted an Aston Martin my whole life and it was clear to me that even though the Jag was 90% the same, and even superior in some ways, that I still, for whatever reason, needed to have one even if it meant delaying RE whenever that would be.  

So I did it.  I bought my dream car and just about broke all the rules doing it which is why I am here to turn in my membership card. 

So first off, the car.  I started out looking for a 'cheap' DB9.  As I went through the process I decided pretty early on that I really wanted three things in the car, the first being it had to be in a color scheme I liked (Aston Martin makes a lot of red and blue interiors, I don't think I could live with that), it needed to be no older than a 2009 (there were a lot of upgrades in that year I wanted) and it needed to be a manual transmission (only 5% of production is manual transmission and they carry a significant premium over the Sportshift cars).  At that point, the market for a car with everything I wanted was WAY more than I originally intended to spend so I thought 'if I'm really going to spend that much, what else should I look at?' which is where I made the jump from DB9 to DBS, the 'flagship' of the Aston Martin line for the years it was in production.  

In the end, I wound up with this: https://imgur.com/aPvsoVY

With the stablemates:  https://imgur.com/qyM5iYN

A 2009 black on black DBS with a manual transmission with ~24,000 miles.  

At over $100k it was REALLY hard to choke down spending that much money and there was no real way to justify it or rationalize it with my FIRE plans that I had been working on for years.  I really just had to bluntly accept the fact that this means working at least an extra year, probably two or more and that in order to make this purchase I would need to be OK with that.  After wrestling with that decision for a couple of weeks I went forward and bought it.

And broke all the rules doing it.  I could have written a check for the car and just been done with it but felt uncomfortable with how much of my taxable brokerage I would need to liquidate to do that.  But the thought of taking on debt to buy something with no real 'need' in my life also was incredibly painful.  In the end, I split the difference and financed half on a 48 month term at 3.6% interest which I thought was quite a reasonable term for something like this.  Turns out that exotic and 'super' car financing is generally pretty good on terms (obviously depending on one's credit).  I rationalized this to myself by looking it the loan as a matter of risk mitigation and by setting up the payment schedule as if it were a 12 months loan and plan to reduce my forward looking savings rate by about 50%.  If something catastrophic went wrong in my life I still have a good cushion to carry me, if nothing goes wrong then I paid very little in interest and my brokerage account is fully replenished to pre-purchase levels in 12 months.  

It was really hard to shake all the lessons learned from reading things like 'The Millionaire Nextdoor', and other such books where it seems like the 'look rich, or be rich' is an either/or proposition and that if I did this, I would never achieve my FIRE dreams forever condemning me to corporate slavery.  And while I couldn't continue to make decisions like this on an ongoing basis my realization is that FIRE does allow for indulgences on occasion, sometimes even great indulgences and that our mantra of 'build the life you want, then save for it' really is a better mindset to adopt.

We are not married so 2 tax returns. (Similar strategy can work for married couple but taxability of SS is slightly higher potentially).

SS at 62 + Trad IRA distribution +Roth distribution= our monthly income of 3,000 each.($6,000 total).
No income tax, the first $12,000 of the Trad IRA is tax free. Roth tax free. SS will not hit threshold for taxation.

Our funds invested at 2.8% for 5 years and bumped up to 3.3% in 2023 (We have a very conservative and modest portfolio) last until our mid 80' s.

Home equity (200) can be tapped or liquidated on a tax free basis. Plan to stay put indefinitely. Maybe take out reverse mortgage or downsize if we're alive and broke at 85?

When I realized all of the above, I amended our retirement date from 67 to 62. It just works out too well NOT to do it this way.

I don't want to wait to get SS at 67 because I might not live that long (applies to everyone on this board.). Also, the IRA distribution would then have to be much higher and the tax free program would switch to a taxable situation, however modest, I like the idea of ZERO taxes on my income after 30 years of paying big taxes.

We are not maximizers...no kids and siblings are all independently wealthy.

We are budgeters...using a padded inflation adjusted budget that funds everything we need and want out of life including modest charitable giving and an RV lifestyle for about 1/2 the year.

We only work during tax season now, so we know what it's like not to have to work. I have 8 months off each year. But I want to retire so I can go South for the winters. (I hate snow.) And I mostly love not working...it ain't perfect, but what is?

As a long time tax guy, I see way too many people die young and never spend a dime of their SS or other funds. Happens all the time. What I almost never see is folks run out of money during retirement. Very rare. (Not talking about the folks who are always broke). Another very common situation is the big wad going to heirs because they over accumulated, could never bring themselves to spend, or they just kick the bucket.

I'm just sayin....😀 Ok, I've said my piece. Tax free retirement...AWESOME. What's not to like?

Footnotes:

We use tax free Muni funds for savings, so another nontaxable aspect.

We own our own businesses and ignore any potential proceeds until we see $, pretend it is zero. Too uncertain at this time.

We ignore potential inheritance. No idea, assume zero.

Up until now, we  have being doing quite well in our quest for FI/RE with a 45% savings rate with no real effort. Currently, we should reach our goal target number in 7-8 years.

​

But now I am expecting twins due early next year. Does anyone have experience raising multiples and how does it impact FI/RE? I am trying to budget how much more we need in liquid cash on top of existing emergency fund for the first year.

​

​

​

Expected 1st year costs:

​

Extra costs incurred with kids:

\- Birthing costs out of pocket assuming c-section $200

\-Accommodation: not moving from our 450sq ft apartment for now. $0

\-Transport: no cars needed in this city. But expected increase in taxi/uber rides.  $1200

\- Childcare: no daycares in this city and I only have 12 weeks maternity leave. But we do have cheap live in helpers. $800/mth or $9600 a year

\- Food: Assuming I go formula only (will attempt to bf while on mat leave), 5\*30oz cans of formula per child $580/mth or $6960 a year

\- Diapers: Newborn 10 a day for 4 months, then 6 a day for 8 months. 2640 diapers per child! $82/mth or $984 a year

\- Stuff for babies (bottles, pump, stroller, crib, toys, etc) $1200

\- Baby checkups: $0

\+ 15% buffer.

=  $23,165 per year!

​

Does this sound right? By my calculations, this would increase our FI/RE from 7.6 years to 9.6 years which is acceptable since I would like to leave this city once they start high school.

In our retirement planning, the big kahuna item always ends up being medical insurance. Any of the Obamacare-compliant plans are very expensive. Medishare is much much less expensive, but I am hesitant to pull the trigger because:

1) They tell you over and over ""its not insurance"" leading me to wonder if it would be there should we have a catastrophic illness

2) The application form required me to assert over and over that I believed in god, went to church etc etc. IRL I am not religious at all. This felt a little sketchy. Again, if we had something big happen, would they find a way to use this as an excuse to not pay, etc ?

Other facts:

Wife and I both 56. Kids in college. I actually retired comfortably at 55, but I went back to work at a startup after a year (fun!), but now looking to retire permanently soon. At our age, medical bills are a big deal. Wife recently had knee replacement, and I had shoulder surgery, among other stuff. This despite being pretty active and in shape overall.

I wanted to first apologise if this is the inappropriate platform to check where I am in terms of my FI/RE status. I originated from PF’s flow chart and have been following its teachings in 2017 and a random comment suggested I go here and I have been tracking my networth ever since and keeping my fees at a minimum for the past year. I hope to fire by 2035, a lot of calculators say I am on track with my 70% SR.

Please criticise as much as you like as I would like a good assessment of my current status is and where are there rooms of improvements that needs to be changed. I am interested in if I should change my portfolio or if there is something that I am missing; like tax advantages I forgot. I am not planning on buying a house in the near future, maybe my future SO and I would think of children and then we’ll get a house.

Thank you in advance and I am sorry for any English grammar mistakes; English isn’t my native tongue.

Some background information if necessary: 27 male immigrant, engineer, but now US citizen, single, not in relationship, no kids, living in California. I have a $95k/year salary and I work 100% remotely. I have a 6 months emergency fund of $2000/month sitting in an Ally savings account 1.8%.

**Monthly Budget**

Here’s my monthly rough breakdown (Total $2200 monthly budgeted). My monthly take home after taxes and tax-advantaged savings is $3000. Anything left over, I either put it in my vacation savings or fund savings.

Category | Amount (USD Monthly) 
:---:|:---:
Rent | 500
Electricity | 200
Gas | 30
Water | 50
Trash | 20
Internet |  80 (company pays)
Food | 300
Gasoline | 20
Cell phone |  130 (family plan that I pay for family)
Fun Fund | 170
Vacation Savings |  200 (I typically plan an international trip once a year)
Investment | 500 (goes into Vanguard Brokerage; VTSAX all the way!)
Total | 2200


**Employer Benefits**

t401k 10% match dollar for dollar (1:1 ratio)

Has a Roth 401k

Has an After Tax 401k (I am unable to roll over to my IRA unless I leave my employer)

Has a Retirement Medical Savings Account (I’m not really sure what this is)



**Personal Investment Accounts** (Rounded to the nearest hundred)

I say personal since these 401k are from being self employed a few years ago

Category | Stock | Amount
:---:|:---:|:---:
Vanguard Brokerage | VTSAX | $37400
Vanguard PreTax 401k | VTTSX (2060 TF Fund) | $15900
Vanguard Post Tax 401k | VTTSX (2060 TF Fund) | $18900
Vanguard Roth IRA | VTTSX (2060 TF Fund) | $19000
Total |  | $91200



**Employer’s 401k Portfolio**

Category | % of Total | Amount | Expense Ratio% 
:---:|:---:|:---: | :---:
INFLATION PROTECTION  | 0.8 | 115.37 | 0.02 | 
FIXED INCOME INDEX  | 0.4 | 57.66 | 0.03 | 
FIXED INCOME  | 1.63 | 233.37 | 0.22 | 
LARGE CAP INDEX | 29.32 | 4208.47 | 0.01 | 
LARGE CAP VALUE | 2.27 | 326.25 | 0.48 | 
SMALL MID CAP INDEX  | 23.08 | 3312.61 | 0.03 | 
SMALL MID CAP VALUE  | 3.35 | 480.46 | 0.67 | 
REIT INDEX | 7.89 | 1132.37 | 0.1 | 
INTERNATIONAL INDEX  | 27.95 | 4012.03 | 0.06 | 
INTERNATIONAL GROWTH  | 1.7 | 243.84 | 0.74 | 
EMERGING MARKETS  | 1.62 | 232.77 | 0.49 | 

Employer’s pre-tax 401k match $4,400 (10% match by end of the year; immediately vested in 
full)

Employers pre-tax 401k $4,300

Employer’s post-tax 401k $5,200

(Both pre-tax and post-tax 401k will max out the $18,500 for 2018)

Employer’s portfolio (market value to the nearest dollar, portfolio %, and expense ratio following 
it)

Employer’s after-tax 401k $0

Employer’s RMSA $0

Employer’s HSA $2000 (no match; but plan on maxing out every year)


**Personal Capital Allocation**

Allocation | % of Total | Amount 
:---:|:---:|:---:
Cash | 3.42% | $3673
International Bond | $1.62 | $1746
US Bonds | $3.22 | $3460
International Stocks | $28.69 | $30860
US Stocks | $60.24 | $64800
Alternatives | $2.42 | $2600

Again, thank you so much for getting my life in order and I appreciate everything you’ve done for me so far. You have no idea how much struggles I’ve had to escape my previous life. This subreddit has really opened my eyes and given me hope for a future of stability, happiness, and peace.

I was born and bred in the UK (London) but moved to Australia (Melbourne) shortly after graduating university in London.

**For those on regular jobs who live in London, FI/RE is extremely difficult to reach due to 3 factors: Housing, Travel and Wages.**

**Housing**

In London if you want to live in a decent suburb, not far from the city - you'd be lucky to pay £650 (\~$1,200) per month to **live in a room in a share house!** I live IN the City Centre in Melbourne, in a luxury condo with beach views, a jacuzzi, swimming pool, private cinema room etc etc with my girlfriend and I pay $900 a month which is \~£500. Before this I lived in a share house just 5 km from the City Centre and paid $400 per month i.e. £222 per month.\*\* Living here allows me to have a luxurious living situation, saving more than I would if renting a small room in Londo\*\*n

​

**Travel**

Travel is amazing in Melbourne, we have a sophisticated tram system which is great, far less crowded than the London tube and COSTS MUCH LESS.  In Melbourne we also have completely free travel within the city centre i.e. the Free Tram Zone. Even without free travel, a monthly travel pass here is around half the price of a monthly travel pass in London. **Living here allows me to spend ZERO of my income on travel!**

​

**Wages**

UK is a low wage economy, with high housing costs - this alone is the sole problem and barrier to people living in London reaching financial independence in &lt;10 years. The average wage in Australia is around $70,000 i.e. around \~£40,000.  The average wage in the UK is nearly half that. The UK has a sharp divide between rich and poor with 20% of its housing being paid for by the government - vs less than 5% here.

​

The economic mess of the UK which I feel Australia uses as a benchmark for what works and what doesn't, makes it extremely hard for the average Londoner to FI/RE.

​

When I moved here I noticed an immediate upgrade in my quality of life (not just by less crime, better weather, better transport services etc etc but **HIGHER WAGES, MUCH CHEAPER HOUSING and ZERO TRAVEL COSTS.**

​

As a native Londoner who now lives in Australia (which has made it possible for me to be on the path to FI/RE, i can tell you that the struggle in London is real. Even for investment bankers on high salaries, the housing costs are just through the roof.

​

USA also has much higher wages than the UK. For anyone on the path to FI/RE in the UK, they would have to be earning a way above average salary and live in a LCOL area.

​

If I still lived in the UK and saw the sort of numbers that people are posting on here with respect to their FI/RE journey, I'd know it would be impossible for me to get there.

​

My advice is to leave the UK and move to a high wage/lower cost of housing country!

​

For anyone who is not in the top 5% of earners, if you thought FI/REing in the UK was easier, you're solely mistaken! It's a huge struggle there and even their minimum wage is much much lower than the minimum wage in Australia - I reckon even someone on the minimum wage in Australia could reach FI/RE easier than someone working a regular job in London.

Just need to convert your current retirement savings to a ratio of your income, select how long you plan to retire and look up the savings rate to achieve a 95% probability of success for a 55 year long retirement.   I thought this group would find it helpful.\n\nSummary table is below, this was based on 2,300 simulation runs using our Monte Carlo simulator.  Each simulation run was 1,000 life times to compute the probabilities.  Took over 4 hours to run plus a ton of time to extract the data in pivot tables.\n\nTo use, calculate your total retirement savings as a % of your current income in left column (0x - 9x) and then the top row is years to retirement (10-1).  Find the savings rate needed at their intersection.\n\nFor example if you currently have saved 5x your income and want to retire in 7 years you need to achieve a 57.5% savings rate to ensure a 95% chance of success based on the Monte Carlo simulation.   If you have no savings and want to retire in ten years you need to plan to save 70% of your income and get pretty lean.\n\n\u200b\n\n# Saving Rate Table\n\n||10 Yr|9 Yr|8 Yr|7 Yr|6 Yr|5 Yr|4 Yr|3 Yr|2 Yr|1 Yr|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|0x|70.0%|72.5%|75.0%|77.5%|80.0%||||||\n|1X|65.0%|67.5%|70.0%|72.5%|75.0%|77.5%|||||\n|2X|62.5%|65.0%|67.5%|70.0%|72.5%|75.0%|77.5%||||\n|3X|57.5%|60.0%|62.5%|65.0%|67.5%|70.0%|75.0%|77.5%|80.0%||\n|4X|55.0%|57.5%|57.5%|62.5%|62.5%|65.0%|70.0%|72.5%|75.0%|77.5%|\n|5X|50.0%|52.5%|55.0%|57.5%|60.0%|65.0%|67.5%|70.0%|72.5%|75.0%|\n|6X|47.5%|50.0%|52.5%|55.0%|55.0%|57.5%|60.0%|65.0%|67.5%|70.0%|\n|7X|45.0%|45.0%|47.5%|47.5%|52.5%|55.0%|57.5%|60.0%|62.5%|67.5%|\n|8X|40.0%|42.5%|45.0%|47.5%|47.5%|50.0%|55.0%|57.5%|60.0%|62.5%|\n|9X|37.5%|37.5%|40.0%|42.5%|45.0%|45.0%|50.0%|52.5%|55.0%|60.0%|\n\n# \n\n# Simulation Assumptions\n\nTo set all the model the parameters, we had to make some assumptions for the simulation. The following are the assumptions we used. These are likely different than your own case, so you will need to review and understand how your situation may be different.\n\n## Saving Rate\n\n1. Savings rate is inclusive of any company match. You should consider the company match as income but only if you are sure it will be vested by your retirement date.\n2. 2.5% wage growth above inflation, based on a young person starting out as new college hire. Initial ten years will see high wage growth.\n3. Wage increase is split between spend and savings per the ratios above. This allows for a little lifestyle inflation. This is also added to the expected income need growth for retirement.\n4. Did not calculate for savings rate above 80%, this is likely not realistic.\n5. Assume income need grows with wage growth, allow for a little lifestyle increase. We keep Saving Rate constant across the simulation for a given lifetime. If you can put all your income growth into savings and keep you spending constant for ten years, then you would be slightly ahead of these scenarios.\n\n## Income Need\n\n1. We assume spending, including taxes, is the remaining income after savings. If the savings rate is 50%, then we assume you are spending the remaining income. That may mean after tax, you may be living on only 35% of your income depending on your tax rate. Need to consider that when looking at you savings rate.\n2. Assume 85% of spending of current spending is need for retirement after adjusted for inflation. This is assuming less taxes on reduced income needs in retirement and assumption other spending levels will decrease since you are no longer working.\n\n## Retirement Length\n\n1. Plan for a 55-year retirement. In previous models, we saw longer retirement windows did not have significant effect on the overall success probability. Once you factor out the sequence risk of running of savings in the first ten years, the survival rates did not change much. This is an area we want to do some more investigation.\n\n## Investment and Inflation\n\n1. 90-year historical performance for investments. Pre-retirement used the 90 Portfolio, Post-Retirement uses the 50 Portfolio based on the data available from Index Fund Advisors ( risk adjusted index portfolios)\n2. 3% inflation rate based on long term historic data.\n3. We did not break out pre-tax and post-tax retirement savings. There can be some optimization for tax purposes, but we did not consider that in this initial study. You will need to review your own situation and savings strategy. For an early retirement it is good to not have all your retirement savings in tax deferred accounts but if you do there are still ways to access this money before age 59.5 without penalties.\n\n## Probability for Success\n\n1. We determine success as 95% success based on the Monte Carlo simulation.  Success means that in 95% of the simulated cases your savings would outlast your projected lifetime.  This should have real world experience closer to 100% based on previous studies. These suggest a 93.4% result from a Monte Carlo analysis would be equivalent to a 100% success in the real world.  Since our model with 1000 runs seems to have a +/- 1% variations compared to a 10,000-run model we used 95% to provide a little margin.\n2. Ran 1000 lifetimes per Monte Carlo simulation. We see about a +/-1% variation compared to a higher number of runs but 4 hours was already a long simulation time.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou can find more details on our [blog here](https://feedingourfire.com/2018/08/retire-in-ten-years) if your interested.

Savings rate is based on gross income (pretax). To normalize the data we don’t know what everyone’s tax situation is and which savings is deferred or not. Taxes are assumed as an expense after savings, so 50k income at 50% savings rate would leave $25k savings, $25k for spend includes covering tax expenses. We also assume company match in both income and savings.\n2. Inflation is 3% with 1% standard deviation (SD). \n3. Also assume a 2.5% wage growth above inflation.\n4. Pre-retire investment growth is 10.74% with 19.85 SD \n5. Post-retire investment growth is 8.12% with 11.16 SD.\n\n\\[**EDIT2**\\]:** Some have commented that using pre tax income for this may be too conservative.  I agree this is conservative.  I think using only post tax income could be optimistic as well. If your retirement savings are heavily balanced towards deferred savings than your withdrawals need to be “taxed up” when you access these funds. You may need more than your pre retirement spending to cover those taxes.  If you just consider post tax numbers you may under estimate the tax burden on these deferred accounts. \n\nEveryone’s situation is different so you should not rely on just a lookup table. A good way is to calculate the savings rate for both cases, pre and post tax incomes and that would provide a good range to work with.    Taxes make things much more complicated so everyone should run there own analysis. We have a fee Excel tool on our website to run your own specific case.

Just need to convert your current retirement savings to a ratio of your income, select how long you plan to retire and look up the savings rate to achieve a 95% probability of success for a 55 year long retirement.   I thought this group would find it helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary table is below, this was based on 2,300 simulation runs using our Monte Carlo simulator.  Each simulation run was 1,000 life times to compute the probabilities.  Took over 4 hours to run plus a ton of time to extract the data in pivot tables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To use, calculate your total retirement savings as a % of your current income in left column (0x - 9x) and then the top row is years to retirement (10-1).  Find the savings rate needed at their intersection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example if you currently have saved 5x your income and want to retire in 7 years you need to achieve a 57.5% savings rate to ensure a 95% chance of success based on the Monte Carlo simulation.   If you have no savings and want to retire in ten years you need to plan to save 70% of your income and get pretty lean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u200b&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Saving Rate

assumptions for the simulation. The following are the assumptions we used. These are likely different than your own case, so you will need to review and understand how your situation may be different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Saving Rate&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Savings rate is inclusive of any company match. You should consider the company match as income but only if you are sure it will be vested by your retirement date.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2.5% wage growth above inflation, based on a young person starting out as new college hire. Initial ten years will see high wage growth.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wage increase is split between spend and savings per the ratios above. This allows for a little lifestyle inflation. This is also added to the expected income need growth for retirement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Did not calculate for savings rate above 80%, this is likely not realistic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assume income need grows with wage growth, allow for a little lifestyle increase. We keep Saving Rate constant across the simulation for a given lifetime. If you can put all your income growth into savings and keep you spending constant for ten years, then you would be slightly ahead of these scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Income Need&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We assume spending, including taxes, is the remaining income after savings. If the savings rate is 50%, then we assume you are spending the remaining income. That may mean after tax, you may be living on only 35% of your income depending on your tax rate. Need to consider that when looking at you savings rate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assume 85% of spending of current spending is need for retirement after adjusted for inflation. This is assuming less taxes on reduced income needs in retirement and assumption other spending levels will decrease since you are no longer working.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Retirement Length&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan for a 55-year retirement. In previous models, we saw longer retirement windows did not have significant effect on the overall success probability. Once you factor out the sequence risk of running of savings in the first ten years, the survival rates did not change much. This is an area we want to do some more investigation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Investment and Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;90-year historical performance for investments.

I am new to this subreddit. Quit Reddit after fighting in other subreddits and realized this is the one that could have a positive influence on my life. The NYT article reminded me that I have been meaning to connect with you guys. 

Here is my story:

Ok, I am in my fifties and single (gay). When I got out of college, I was put almost immediately into default for my student loans. That meant I couldn’t apply for grad school and it also meant I spent 10 years with ZERO CREDIT. Because this was student debt, i could  not declare bankruptcy and there was no 7 year limit.  I was depressed and resigned myself to being a loser in life. My only credit card was a secured one. But, I am sure you people can imagine the discipline I learned over 10 years. 

Bill Clinton signed something  that gave me a second chance with my $21k in Student Loans. I was a CS/Math major which meant I was able to at least stay employed and make a decent salary, I remember coming up with a long-term payment strategy, at the end of which I would get my credit back. I started paying and had an epiphany “What if I sacrificed and just put every cent I can into these loans? 
After 18 months, the loans were paid off. My salary was $40k/year and little did I know I’d be making 6 figures within 2 years. 

At that same time, at the age of 32, our CEO held an all-hands to tell us about the power of a 401k. I liked the idea of the company match, and went for it, albeit not as aggressively as I could have. But I stuck with it and never withdrew from it, not even when the dot com’s busted up and then 911 happened and Inwas barely employed doing one-off freelance work. The discipline I learned from my twenties cane in quite handy.

Two years after 911 I got a contract at a Biotech company after working contracts at KPMG and IBM, Both offered me full-time work which I refused. I knew then I was tired of corporate America and never felt welcomed. 

I don’t know what you all know about drug companies, but the compensation package is very similar to the tech stories I’ve read on here. You get a healthy Basel % of vase for bonus, stock grants that vest in thirds yearly and you can buy stock at a15% discount quarterly. 401k match is 200% up to 3% of salary. 

 Because this thread is getting too long I’ll cut to the chase. Here is where I am today:

My base salary + bonus barely exceed $200k. 

My 401k consists of mutual funds and cash to total $762k ( I consolidated with my former 401ks ) I am contributing 15%. I moved $250k of that money to a Money Market to stem losses during the next inevitable recession. 

I have $250k in company stock. I also have $100k in Amazon and about $50k in Apple. I bought fb right after it’s IPO, but sold after learning how irresponsible they were with a data breach they could have avoided. I made good money on that stock. 

My total taxable is $461k,

I paid cash for my AMG CL 45 which has a book value of about $35k.

Our company stock jumped over the summer.  I still owed $100k on my mortgage. If our promising drug is approved, the stock could double or triple. If not, it could halve. I imagined hating myself if the stock halved, so I decided to sell $100k of company stock to pay off the mortgage. 

I am new debt free. 

So, what is my problem?

I hate Massachusetts and want badly to move to New York. I am getting older and life is passing me by. I plan to rent my condo and use the proceeds to subsidize renting in Hell)s Kitchen, NYC. I am ready to go tomorrow with or without a job.

BUT, I suspect I am up for a promotion at work which would happen between now and February. Yes, I am anxious to move but I didn’t get here by making irresponsible financial decisions. A promotion would bump my bonus up quite a bit and possibly increase my pay substantially. It would be a Director role. 

So...

Do I just say “fuck it” and move, or do I wait a year and save more money? If I choose the latter, I hope to rent a place in NYC and go up,on weekends. I would probably need to move in with someone looking for a roommate to do that. Is it possible at my age?

Hi everyone, 

A few months ago I turned 24 and I’m excited to say that today my NW has just surpassed my first big milestone of $100k. My plan for this post, and the subsequent ones to follow, is to keep track of my mindset towards FI, towards work, any goal changes, and anything else I seem to be pondering over. It would be great to have this as a reference point for myself for the years to come on my journey as well as seek out some advice from others on anything that might be on my mind. I’ve seen several posts in this format and it’s extremely inspiring to read about some of the awesome journeys that most of you are going through while on your way to FI and (potentially) RE. This may read more like a blog/journal entry, so bear with me, but I’d love to hear some thoughts on anything you might pick up on while reading.

    
I’ll preface this by saying that I have been extremely lucky in a number of ways that have allowed me to reach this point so relatively early with the below points. 

*  I was fortunate enough to have graduated from college completely debt free due entirely to parental assistance and with about 10-12k in my pockets from an internship opportunity. This is by far, one of the most, if not the most important, head-start I’ll have in life.
*  I am able to live with my parents for an indefinite period. Fortunately my relationship with my family is healthy, but it has weighed on me for some time about feeling like I’m taking advantage of their generous hospitality and while I do contribute to the household ecosystem in a beneficial way, I feel as if there’s room to make more of an effort ease the “burden” of my living in the house. My parents are relatively self-sufficient when it comes to household things, give or take moving the heavier boxes or furniture, but they can definitely manage on their own. In any case, I don’t have an exact date in mind, but I do plan to try and move out before my 26th or 27th birthday.
* By a stroke of luck, I found out about MMM and Financial Independence only a little over a year ago, allowing me to start relatively early and change my goals to align with reaching FI.

Some stats to put things into perspective:

*  	Graduated in Mid 2016, accepted first full-time job offer, and began working in January of 2017 in the IT space at a great company.
* 	Salary 

 * 2017: Mid 50s
 * 2018: Raise to Low-Mid 60s + 12% bonus on last year’s numbers =  ~ 70k gross income for 2018 year
*  	**Assets** (Sorted High to Low) 
 *  	**Taxable Accounts** - 54k~ (All leftover cash goes here each month or paycheck, about 2k~ a month)
 *   **401k** -  26.5k~ (Maxed out Contributions this year, but didn’t last year)
 *  	**Roth IRA** – 12k~ (Try to just drop the 5.5k in at the start of every year)
 *  	**HSA** – 1k~ Uninvested, 2.3k~ Invested; (Just started contributing, this year. Initially I wasn’t planning to until next year, but after reading about MadFientists article on the power of the HSA I was sold)
 *  	**Leftover Savings Bonds** - 3k~ (Waiting on these bad boys to fully mature before cashing out on them, last one should be in a couple years)
 *  	**Cash** – 2K~ (Usually don't keep any more than this in cash since I don't have any big expenses. This will increase when I move out I'd think)
*   **Savings Rate** – Hovers between 80-90% right now which is amazing. Once I move out this will of course drop, but reading MMM and ERE has been a great head-start into thinking about cost savings when I’m on my own.

**Fancy Graphs and Data Tracking**

One part of my financial learning has been about how to effectively use Excel to keep track of expenses, earnings, investments, and budgeting ideas. This is something I have an enormous amount of fun doing.
This sheet has evolved and grown over the past year due to an obsessive amount of tracking. Eventually I stumbled upon [this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7nglui/2017_yearend_review_and_pretty_charts/) by /u/FItemp34097 . Which gave me some amazing ideas for how to organize my spreadsheet. If you’d like to see how it works a little better, check out his post, or feel free to ask any questions as I’ve modified it here and there to fit my needs. Getting it to where it should be exactly is still a work in progress so you’ll likely see some erroneous data in places…

[Charts](https://imgur.com/a/DKFAWTU)

In addition to this, I’m working on a way to automatically grab values from my accounts and import them into my Excel sheets. It’s relatively clunky and personalized, so nothing really worth showing off, but I feel it makes it clear how much drive I have to set these kinds of things up for my finances. 

**Current Lifestyle / About Me**

I currently live about 4 miles from my office and try my best to bike in at least twice a week. Sometimes more; sometimes less. While biking to work is good exercise, I do still try to work out at the local gym which I (luckily) get free entry to, due to my mom working there, but I likely would not pay for a gym membership and instead do body weight exercises if not for that. I was much more, I wouldn’t say motivated, but more disciplined last year with my working out and have slowed down since, but I’m attempting to pick up the pace again this year after the short slump. 

I’ve made a good group of friends in some of my co-workers such that we eat lunch together (packed lunches on my end!) and we occasionally hang out after work. I still live in the town that I grew up in along with a good chunk of my best friends from school as well. As such, my in-person non-work social interactions are still frequent, which is wonderful and often feel like I may be taking this luxury for granted. On the other hand, I do often find myself at home preferring to play video games (a big part of my life), albeit with those same friends. As I stated before, I don’t make many big expenses, but the biggest I made recently was building a new computer for about 2k with the bonus I received. I felt I would treat myself to it as I know I would get a great amount of usage out of it, and the rest went straight into my investments. Other than that, I try to keep my expenses down to a minimum, even with the fact that I am not paying for rent, groceries, or utilities aside from my phone/car insurance. 

**Things I’ve Learned Since Beginning my Journey**

* I’ve learned a huge amount about finances which I never had a thought about prior to this time period in my life. 
* I’ve learned about how 401ks, IRAs, Taxes (to a point), Net Worth, and Investments work. It’s actually a super interesting field to me which I never expected. Though I think the majority of that intrigue comes from the fact that it’s MY money.
* I’ve learned about budgeting my money and the power of frugality
* I’ve learned about maintaining a bike
* I’ve learned how to use power tools to build/work with wood. Built my own computer desk to suit my needs and recently built a cornhole set with my friends for fun
* I’m learning more and more in my own field through projects at work and my own personal projects
* I’ve learned how to cook some great meals using cheap raw ingredients. I’ve found that I LOVE to cook, making meals up based on whatever is available.
* I’ve learned a bit about hiking, trailblazing, and mapping a trail. (Fun, but I have an innate fear of a bear coming up out the water, so it distracts me a lot from the enjoyment at times…)
* I’ve learned about being confident with my abilities as an individual in general. (Prior to the job I have now, I had an offer for a job a couple states away that I didn’t initially go through with due to the fear of being somewhere new without much local support. Now, however, I think I definitely could brave the change if it were to happen. )

Overall, I feel like I am way more confident in myself with how much I’ve absorbed since starting, especially with respect to finances. I'm looking forward to what else I can improve on and learn about anything I can.
 
**Goals for the future / Things I want to learn**

* I want to learn more about finances. I want to learn about Real Estate, try to learn more about taxes, and evaluating companies for investment purposes.
* I want to learn about maintaining a vehicle. Maybe try to do my own oil change at first or something, but just overall try and gain an understanding of how they work in general.
* I want to try and cut my own hair. I almost tried last weekend, but I chickened out.
* I want to learn more about Game Design, especially art. I dabbled in making some games on my own with Unity while I was job hunting prior to finding my current job and it was very fun. I think a dream would be to develop a game and launch it on Steam.
* Currently I’m thinking about potentially renting or buying a house. My company is (unfortunately) not renewing the lease for the office I'm in and will definitely have a much further commute from my current residence. That being said, I’m very hesitant on buying a house due to a few reasons. High property taxes in my state, uncertainty on what makes a house good to buy (can obviously improve with more knowledge), and fear of ending up buying at an overvalued price. In one of the most recent posts I read about one of the key factors in deciding to buy a house if making sure you get a good initial deal so I want to make sure I’m not making a bad decision timing wise and would prefer to be patient and learn more while I have the opportunity (this sounds a lot like market timing, but maybe it’s different in this case?) Ultimately, I think I would like to own a house, but am not against renting permanently either. 
* I want to build more (Next up is an under-desk drawer!) and learn more about fixing up a house. If I do ever own one, I want to be mostly self-sufficient with maintaining it.
 
**Other Thoughts / Struggles / Ideas**

  **Work**

When I first learned about FI, my brother had sent me an article from MMM ( [this one I believe](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/11/11/how-much-is-too-much-in-your-401k/) ) when I was first joining my new job and trying to learn about contributing to my 401k and such. I think this story is pretty familiar for most after their first couple of MMM posts, (or ERE or whichever way you found out about FI) in that I went ahead and began binge reading from the start of the vast list of posts and information out there on FI. I was hooked from that moment on. Every fiber of my being strives to reach FI as early as possible, the majority of that stemming from my outlook on work/life. I think the one word I can use to describe myself when it comes to working a fulltime job is: Unmotivated. I am content with doing enough to get by for a job that I’m not passionate about. I want to spend my time doing that which I enjoy and working hard on my own terms. Doing projects that I deem worthy of my full 110% effort. In the end, it really has turned me off from work in general, meeting deadlines, and stressing about finishing (or not being able to finish) my work. Though, I’m unsure as to whether this is strictly for working under someone else or if it’s an issue of passion. This is something that’s been weighing on me more recently, however, since work has picked up quite a bit due a transformation in the part of the organization I work in where I’m one of the pivot points. I’m all up for challenging myself to learn, but the stress created from this has been a lot to handle. I know that I’ll likely be rewarded greatly for taking this on and pulling through, but part of me is dissatisfied with my job in the sense that it is a cause for a major amount of stress. And even though I do love the company I work for, I'm not absolutely in love with what I do. The less emotional part of me is saying that I’m lucky to have the job I have, because of the great benefits, vacation time, decent pay for my position, and I’m worried that I won’t find a better company out there in those regards. It also feels shitty and “complainy” to feel like I’m “burning out” less than two years into a job. I’m wondering if it might be a good idea to look into getting a different job within the same company, but it might be hard to bring it up at this time due to the impact it might have on my team's output. Alternatively, I’ve recently been toying a lot with the idea of coasting to FI after a certain point; Thinking about random jobs I could have, living frugally, and making enough to survive. Doing all of that without dipping into my investments seems entirely possible and exciting to me even if it’s not my ultimate ideal (FIRE as early as possible). I find myself very frequently envisioning myself doing some other job and thinking on how it might go. Overall, I feel like I may need to make a change at some point if my mindset suffers any further. If anyone else has had similar thoughts or would just like tell me I’m being silly, please let me know what you think, as this is one of the main things weighing on me currently.

 
 **Post-FIRE Lifestyle**

One of the things that I’m sure some of you’ve experienced are questions from family and friends regarding “What you plan to do when not working?”. To me that answer is simple. Whatever the hell I want! I’m not worried in the slightest in my ability to find enjoyment in anything (or conversely, nothing), as long as it’s on my terms. I know it’s bad to speak from such little experience on the topic, but I really have not one worry that I would end up being bored or dissatisfied once I’m FIRE’d. Even if I didn’t have SO many other potential interests in my life, I feel as if I could play video games/watch Netflix for an eternity and still be content with myself, which seems like a great FIRE trait to have. Due to both this and my outlook on work, I think I'd be content with a leaner than average FIRE, but I'm aware there's always things that can change that goal along the way. (Mainly Health/Love/Finding a job I absolutely love)

Another big question I get is “Where do you plan to live?”, this one’s a little tricky still for me. My family is a big part of my life and it would be a major change if at any point I wasn’t living in the same state as them. As I said before, I don’t think that buying a house in my state would be something I’m interested in doing, and I think I would be able to handle moving away and being on my own, but I’m still hesitant to do so. I think my parents especially would be pretty devastated even though my siblings will likely still live in the area for years to come. For friends, I’m less worried because of the fact that a good chunk of time I spend with them is online anyway and I think I’m pretty decent at making friends. However, it will likely be much more difficult to do so if I’m not working in an office or something. I’ve (very briefly) toyed with the idea of living in a different country, but at the moment I haven't given it too much headway as it’s a slightly unnerving thought to me at the moment. I’ll need to learn more about different countries before really thinking about it as a real possibility. I have extended family on the other side of the country in a really nice LCOL area, so this is also an option too as a midpoint between the two. (Living near family, but also on my own).

I think there’s room for me to spend more money in some areas (mainly in a social context), but I have no real need to. I have gotten some minor backlash from friends and family alike on my style of frugality and it’s something I still struggle with, but have been way better at lately. I feel as if I come off as cheap, more so than frugal and I want to work on making this impression better for myself in their eyes. If anyone has any tips on this kind of thing, please reach out because I’d love to hear it! 


**Overall**, I’m pretty proud with where I am right now. I’ve learned a whole lot that I’m proud of myself for and I’m excited to see where these next few years take me. There's definitely so much more to discover about myself and my needs once I move out on my own, so it's hard to project a true date for my complete FIRE, but I think I'm at a good place. I know my story isn't anything extraordinary, but I appreciate anyone taking the time to have made it to the end! I think the next time I write will be at 200k, or next year, not sure which yet. Happy FIRE’ing everyone!
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CyEGUrE9K10q11ZDHe1LBJi0VKLgqSOq/view?usp=sharing""&gt;Scrubbed Excel for anyone who wanted it!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=14w9KFC59zqDh6p-IHFc6tvVSkv-EfGHw""&gt;Smaller Excel for those using Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I turned 24 and I’m excited to say that today my NW has just surpassed my first big milestone of $100k. My plan for this post, and the subsequent ones to follow, is to keep track of my mindset towards FI, towards work, any goal changes, and anything else I seem to be pondering over. It would be great to have this as a reference point for myself for the years to come on my journey as well as seek out some advice from others on anything that might be on my mind. I’ve seen several posts in this format and it’s extremely inspiring to read about some of the awesome journeys that most of you are going through while on your way to FI and (potentially) RE. This may read more like a blog/journal entry, so bear with me, but I’d love to hear some thoughts on anything you might pick up on while reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll preface this by saying that I have been extremely lucky in a number of ways that have allowed me to reach this point so relatively early with the below points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I was fortunate enough to have graduated from college completely debt free due entirely to parental assistance and with about 10-12k in my pockets from an internship opportunity. This is by far, one of the most, if not the most important, head-start I’ll have in life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I am able to live with my parents for an indefinite period. Fortunately my relationship with my family is healthy, but it has weighed on me for some time about feeling like I’m taking advantage of their generous hospitality and while I do contribute to the household ecosystem in a beneficial way, I feel as if there’s room to make more of an effort ease the “burden” of my living in the house. My parents are relatively self-sufficient when it comes to household things, give or take moving the heavier boxes or furniture, but they can definitely manage on their own. In any case, I don’t have an exact date in mind, but I do plan to try and move out before my 26th or 27th birthday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By a stroke of luck, I found out about MMM and Financial Independence only a little over a year ago, allowing me to start relatively early and change my goals to align with reaching FI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some stats to put things into perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Graduated in Mid 2016, accepted first full-time job offer, and began working in January of 2017 in the IT space at a great company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salary &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2017: Mid 50s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018: Raise to Low-Mid 60s + 12% bonus on last year’s numbers =  ~ 70k gross income for 2018 year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets&lt;/strong&gt; (Sorted High to Low) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Taxable Accounts&lt;/strong&gt; - 54k~ (All leftover cash goes here each month or paycheck, about 2k~ a month)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;401k&lt;/strong&gt; -  26.5k~ (Maxed out Contributions this year, but didn’t last year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Roth IRA&lt;/strong&gt; – 12k~ (Try to just drop the 5.5k in at the start of every year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;HSA&lt;/strong&gt; – 1k~ Uninvested, 2.3k~ Invested; (Just started contributing, this year. Initially I wasn’t planning to until next year, but after reading about MadFientists article on the power of the HSA I was sold)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Leftover Savings Bonds&lt;/strong&gt; - 3k~ (Waiting on these bad boys to fully mature before cashing out on them, last one should be in a couple years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Cash&lt;/strong&gt; – 2K~ (Usually don&amp;#39;t keep any more than this in cash since I don&amp;#39;t have any big expenses. This will increase when I move out I&amp;#39;d think)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings Rate&lt;/strong&gt; – Hovers between 80-90% right now which is amazing. Once I move out this will of course drop, but reading MMM and ERE has been a great head-start into thinking about cost savings when I’m on my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fancy Graphs and Data Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One part of my financial learning has been about how to effectively use Excel to keep track of expenses, earnings, investments, and budgeting ideas. This is something I have an enormous amount of fun doing.
This sheet has evolved and grown over the past year due to an obsessive amount of tracking. Eventually I stumbled upon &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7nglui/2017_yearend_review_and_pretty_charts/""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=""/u/FItemp34097""&gt;/u/FItemp34097&lt;/a&gt; . Which gave me some amazing ideas for how to organize my spreadsheet. If you’d like to see how it works a little better, check out his post, or feel free to ask any questions as I’ve modified it here and there to fit my needs. Getting it to where it should be exactly is still a work in progress so you’ll likely see some erroneous data in places…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/DKFAWTU""&gt;Charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, I’m working on a way to automatically grab values from my accounts and import them into my Excel sheets. It’s relatively clunky and personalized, so nothing really worth showing off, but I feel it makes it clear how much drive I have to set these kinds of things up for my finances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Lifestyle / About Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently live about 4 miles from my office and try my best to bike in at least twice a week. Sometimes more; sometimes less. While biking to work is good exercise, I do still try to work out at the local gym which I (luckily) get free entry to, due to my mom working there, but I likely would not pay for a gym membership and instead do body weight exercises if not for that. I was much more, I wouldn’t say motivated, but more disciplined last year with my working out and have slowed down since, but I’m attempting to pick up the pace again this year after the short slump. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a good group of friends in some of my co-workers such that we eat lunch together (packed lunches on my end!) and we occasionally hang out after work. I still live in the town that I grew up in along with a good chunk of my best friends from school as well. As such, my in-person non-work social interactions are still frequent, which is wonderful and often feel like I may be taking this luxury for granted.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;, I’m pretty proud with where I am right now. I’ve learned a whole lot that I’m proud of myself for and I’m excited to see where these next few years take me. There&amp;#39;s definitely so much more to discover about myself and my needs once I move out on my own, so it&amp;#39;s hard to project a true date for my complete FIRE, but I think I&amp;#39;m at a good place. I know my story isn&amp;#39;t anything extraordinary, but I appreciate anyone taking the time to have made it to the end! I think the next time I write will be at 200k, or next year, not sure which yet. Happy FIRE’ing everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

4. I haven’t come to terms with the notion of drawing down assets instead of accumulating assets. Many years of being in the habit of accumulation is a hard habit to change.

5. I don’t have a clear vision for retirement. Traveling for a year or two after my wife retires would be fun. But then what? I’m in good health and I anticipate 30+ years in retirement.

6. I like the concept of volunteering and have volunteered for a number of organizations. But I’m not very patient and can’t stand to be used unproductively.

I’m earning $115k, SR 16% and my 401k just hit $50k. 

I’ve got about $400k in home equity and could really afford to save more but I think I’ve got decent balance right now. 

That is all!

Edit :

Hey, since this one is getting more attention than I thought it would and to give some more detail :

I am 37 and live in a HCOL area.

I make $115k and my wife makes $75k. We have one child. I work in aerospace manufacturing.

We have a house and a condo with combined equity at this point of about $400k. 
This equity came from selling our first house, putting all equity ($125k) into the new house plus some savings. 

Condo was purchased with 20% cash down and we carry a mortgage but values around here have been going up at a staggering clip (PNW).

My SR is 16% - 10% 401K and 6% discount stock.
I get a 3% match from my company on the 401K and 15% off market pricing on company stock. 

Company is a Fortune 500 manufacturer and is well diversified as far as what industries they serve.
Should my contribution to my discount stock be higher? Probably.

My SR could be higher but I am comfortable, we are able to do what we want when we want and I don't feel that I'm being irresponsible at my current SR. 

I'm a victim of lifestyle creep for sure so I've been making a conscious effort to reign that in.

Let me know if you have any more questions - I'll try to answer everyone and thank you for the feedback!

Although I do invest, I've let large amounts of cash sit idle for a long time which is a mistake.  Currently in about 25% cash.  If I'd been better about investing 10 years ago we could have retired by now.  

​

I'm 45, my wife is 43.

We're both self employed - I do video production part time and make between $50-100k (it varies) per year gross at that (or have the last 6 years or so) and my wife is a piano teacher part time, she makes around $38k.  We have 2 kids that are 4 and 7.

I think our net worth is about 1.4M

\~$360k in taxable brokerage accounts

\~$25k in Roth IRA's

\~$112k in SEP IRA's

\~$164k in traditional IRA's

\~$50k in HSA's

\~$42k in kid's 529

\~$30k in cash/checking/savings

Our expenses come to about $60k a year - this excludes saving for retirement or college, but does include HSA's.

A few musical instruments that have quite a bit of value - my wife's steinway cost more than our cars put together.  But we're not selling them ever so no point in assessing value.

Our house, which we bought in 2004 is probably worth about $600,000 and we owe $87k on it - should be done in 7 years or so at current rate of payments.

Anyway, I feel like we're doing pretty good considering we haven't invested super aggressively and for the most part our earnings have always been modest - there were a few years in there where I made almost nothing and we've never had a penny of matching funds from an employer (neither of us has held a ""real"" job more than a year or so).

My current video production contract is over in 2020 and after that I have to figure out what I'm going to do...not sure - I'm unsure what the market will be for people like me.  My wife will probably work until she's 80, which is typical for piano teachers.  I'll probably have an decent inheritance at some point but who knows - however my folks have been very aggressive in trying to grow the trust and protect it - and they have pensions that go till both are dead so they should be covered ok - so I think my share should be around $750k in today's dollars.

​

Anyway, my wife and I were talking the other day about that it feels like we're doing better than most of our peers except those that are clearly rich folks (and have high paying jobs) and we're kinda clueless as to why that is.  All our friends seem like they are stressed about money and don't have much saved for retirement, but I think we'd be ok if I quit most work in a couple years and the house is almost paid off - I can probably find something that makes 25-50k; just jobs here and there.

First let me say that this sub has changed my life completely.  

I am a divorced 37 Year old single male with 1 child, living in a HCOL area.  6 Years ago I had a -40K net worth after a tough divorce, and I was out of work.  I am in software sales, and fortunately since then I had a good couple of years, where I was able to learn to earn and save and with tips from r/financialindependence, r/Frugal, and r/Flipping to get where I am today.  

Current Net Worth: 460K

IRA: 60K (diversified ETFS)

529: 10K (age based plan)

401K: 140K (Max contributions, 3% match, 2045 Target Retirement Mix Fund)

Cash: 250K

I max out my 401K and IRA every year, but currently make too much for a ROTH.

Here in lies my problem.  As you can see, I am sitting in too much cash, and essentially losing money to inflation.  I would like to be somewhat conservative with my cash, and keep it liquid if I want to buy a house or buy a business.  Also, Ive went broke 2x (2008 &amp; divorce in 2012), so I really cant stomach the S&amp;P500 for short term swings.  

Any advice on how to conservatively invest the 250K for liquidity, \~&gt;4% return using vanguard funds or ETFs?  I am currently looking at short term retirement funds like 2021 and such.

Thanks all for the advice, and keep going for FIRE.  If I can do it, you can do it!  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

It all caught me totally off guard but I was just as delighted as I was shocked. This new deal will grant me about a 20% pay increase along with being accepted into the union our company is part of/works with. This will now also net me a pension and annuity.

Here is where I’m a bit lost as to how early retirement or FIRE comes into play. The pension considers normal retirement age at 65 and early retirement at 62. The annuity is set at age 59.5 and 55 for early retirement. Early retirement and withdrawal results in a penalty. You become vested for the pension after working a certain number of hours each year and I should become fully vested after 4 years if I continue working my normal 40-50 hour work weeks. The handbook also states that to be able to accept collecting from either of these plans (with penalties if collecting at early retirement) you must be both vested and retired at age 55 or above.

My question is can I still collect my pension and annuity if I retire at say 45 instead of 59.5 years or older and delay collecting? My FIRE plan was to retire at 45, not touch anything, and if possible delay collecting the annuity until age 59.5 and pension until age 65 so I could avoid the early withdrawal penalties and have additional money to rely on during my later years along with my SWR payouts from my regular portfolio. What I’m not sure on is if I have actually have to work until 55 to be eligible to collect either of these things? Will I lose everything/become ineligible if I retire before age 55 or does this just mean I can’t start collecting until age 55 or older?

Some additional info. It’s a union company and the employer pays these benefits into a fund based on $ amount set for each hour you work. For example, every hour you work the employer contributes $5 to your annuity and $7 to your pension. The employee pays nothing into either fund. I’m treating it all like SS in the sense that I can survive retirement comfortably without any of it but with it I would go from normal FIRE to potentially borderline fat FIRE which admittedly sounds very nice. I’m also aware of how some pension and annuity plans have been cut, eliminated, or grossly mismanaged which is why I haven’t included them in my calculations.

Hopefully I explained my problem clear enough but let me know if any questions. I know pensions and annuities are getting rarer and rarer today but thought you guys would be the best folks to answer something like this. I meet with my union rep next week so I’m sure I can ask them some stuff but my employer will be in room for some parts of the meeting and I don’t exactly want to mention my FIRE plans this early on.

I'm 40, 95% FIRE, but in transition period. I've been running a business for the last 12 years. I'm just so bored. And maybe having an existential crisis. 

Stuff like travel, volunteering, hobbies, just seem so trivial and pointless. It feels like these things are for relaxing after work. But in isolation have much less utility when there is nothing to relax from. Going on holiday from this already relaxing life has zero appeal.

I wish I had the imagination or creativity, to write books, make stuff. But i'm not sure I do. I like doing other people's crossword puzzles. Studying held some interest for a while, but it just is hard to keep motivated without a longer term plan.

I feel like I can't renter the workforce either, as no-one will hire someone who has been doing their own thing for a decade. It's obvious i have leverage and employers don't like that. 

I'm seeing a therapist but he is obviously tired of listening to my 'problems' and can't understand why, if I'm so bored, i just don't get up and do something.

The stuff people suggest, join a book group, volunteer,  learn a language, seems like the kinds of suggestions given to elderly care home residents, to keep the inmates quiet and pass the time until they go to sleep. It just seems designed to pass the time.

This was originally written for r/airforce, so it's from a military perspective, but I figured you guys would might like to read it, too. PCS/PCSing = permanent change of station, or when we move from one base to another. BAH = basic allowance for housing. 

TL;DR: Rental real estate is a pain, but can be very lucrative if done right. Here's a whole bunch of things you might need to consider.

EDIT: Alrighty, I'm wrong about depreciation. Depreciation is still a thing, still affects your personal income taxes, but I'm heading right back to google to correct my own information. Guys, I wrote this whole thing off the top of my head based on what I have personally learned, and I sincerely apologize, I don't mean to be handing out bad advice. Looks like I personally need to learn a whole bunch more about how depreciation recapture works. 

EDIT 2: The VA and FHA loans *can* be good options. However, YOU need to shop all of your options. Do not just assume that the VA is the best way to go. If it is the best option for you, go for it. If not, go with other financing. 

Edit 3: I'm pretty risk averse when it comes to over-leveraging. I'm never going to suggest that someone buy a house with nothing down, especially not while in the military and subject to a short notice relocation. If you do your own research and choose to buy with nothing down, that's on you. I'm still not comfortable with it. 

Alright... wall of text coming in. Take what you can and leave what's not useful. Everything written here is what I've personally learned. I'm not a realtor or a professional property manager, but have been a landlord for 6+ years and have learned a lot. Most of those lessons learned had huge price tags on them, too. I purchased my first home in 2011, our second in 2014, and our third just last year. The first two are rented out. Not everything will apply to you, but here's what I've learned along the way. Topics are written in the order that I thought of them, my apologies if it's not 100% cohesive. As of right now, I have awesome tenants in both properties, but that hasn't always been the case. My approach to real estate is to 1, protect my own investment and 2, to provide a good home to my tenants. I've made some more generous financial decisions to both of those extents, and while those decisions cut into my profits a bit, I have no regrets. 

**Purchasing your first home**

**Should I rent or purchase?**

Don't over buy on your first purchase.

I say again, don't over buy.

If the market is white hot, it's going to cool off. And you don't want to be holding the chips when that happens. You really don't have the time to sit on the house and let it recover, unless you've got money somewhere you're not talking about. 2008 took about 10 years to fully recover from and to gain back the lost appreciation (most markets, at least) and you don't have 10 years. ​ If you do a zero down VA loan and roll the closing costs into the loan, it takes, on average, the first 18 months just to pay off the closing costs. Takes about 3 more years to get down to a break-even point with seller's closing costs included, and about 5 years before you'll make money. Yes, it seems like a lot of BAH to be ""throwing away"", but look at the actual makeup of a newly amortized mortgage - most of your payment is going towards things other than principle.

If you bring a down payment to the table, you've mitigated that part of your risk, but you're still exposed to lose money at the sale of the house. You've still got your purchase closing costs, which, on a $190k house are probably between $6000 and $9000, depending on your financing. Most of that is money that just evaporates.

If you can rent for LESS than the interest/insurance/taxes part of the payment and just dump the principal part into savings/mutual funds/TSP/IRA, you'll come out ahead. Granted, that normally means renting a smaller apartment instead of living in a nice house, but it's the sacrifice we make to be financially responsible.

Money in real estate is made 3 ways:

1, getting a good deal on the purchase.

2, holding the property for forever and getting the appreciation.

3, renting it out and making a profit off of someone else.

Normally, you want a good mix of all 3. The first takes PATIENCE when you're looking to purchase, and from what you've told me, a good deal just isn't available to purchase in Vegas right now. Strike one. Are you going to live in it long enough to ride out the bubble you see and make money when you sell? Meh, maybe not. Strike two. Do you want to landlord? If you've thought about it, scroll up and re-read again. If you're still on board, then its a consideration ​

Renting is buying patience. Seems like in your area, patience is what you need. There's always a house to buy in the future.

Rents do rise and fall, but they don't rise and fall nearly as fast as real estate does in a white-hot market. Hence the 1% per month rental price as an approximation. If there's a $200,000 house that's renting for $1500 a month, and the house next door sells for $220,000, the first house likely went up 10% in value. However, your landlord isn't going to jack your rent 10% in the middle of the lease just because Zillow thinks his house is now worth what the one next door sold for. If you rent, you're protected from the competitive spikes in purchasing, and are more exposed to the long-term appreciation of pricing. Your landlord's costs of ownership are fixed (unless he's on an interest only loan, and then he's stupid), so he can offer you rent at a fixed or gradually increasing rate. He's not trying to compete with other buyers to purchase a first home like you are. 

**VA Loan**

The VA loan... not my favorite topic. First off, you're almost always better off going with conventional financing if you've got a down payment, and no one should ever purchase a home if they don't have one. The VA loan brags about not having PMI, but the funding fee is essentially pre-paid PMI. On a conventional loan, you can request that PMI be removed once you hit 78% LTV, but there's no option to un-do the prepayment of the funding fee. 

The first time the VA loan is used, the funding fee is 2.15% of the loan. After that, it's 3.3% of the loan unless the borrower brings 5% down. (https://www.veteransunited.com/education/library/va-funding-fee/)

The max amount of loan that the VA will insure is $453,000. You can have more than one VA loan at a time, but the two can NOT total more than that amount. With the median home price today, you're likely going to be going with conventional financing on the next house, anyway. The other option is to refinance the soon to be rental with conventional financing and re-use the VA entitlement on the new purchase, but again, I tend to shy away from VA loans all together. 

When I purchased my last home, my loan officer just assumed that I'd go with VA financing. I asked her to pull a quote for conventional and give me the break-even point. She didn't want to, but I made her do it anyway. She was shocked that, wow, I was right about my financing options. Not to brag, but she's used to checking boxes on paperwork, while I'm used to scrimping to make that precious SSgt pay last as far as possible.

**I'm buying near a military base, it's a good market, right?**

Ah, but buying close to base is BAD for appreciation. Because of the high turnover of military personal, there's always someone trying to sell their house. Always a lot of people, actually. This leads to high inventory and low demand. When there's high inventory, people start dropping prices to sell faster. You've seen the opposite right now in Vegas - low inventory and high demand cause a price spike. Same math, different side of the equation. 

With values depressed because of high inventory, sellers in a heavily military area will likely sell for their break-even point. If sales prices don't go up, neither does value. Neither does rents, and so BAH remains flat. BAH remains flat, and the next guy can't afford to buy your house for any more than you bought it for. It's a vicious cycle and it's common near bases. In this equation, the only people making any money are the real estate agents who have an unlimited supply of customers. 

The plus side is that you can usually get a lot of house for the money near a base. The only real way to break that cycle is to have an outside economic influence bleeding off the extra inventory. This happens when a small(ish) base is located in an area with other good paying jobs. If the only places to work in a 20 minute radius are the base and retail, tread carefully. 

**Working with a realtor**

Realtors are real estate professionals, and I always recommend a first time buyer work with a good agent. However, keep in mind that the realtor has a vested interest in you purchasing just as much home as you can. Same thing with the bank, they WANT you to borrow as much as they can reasonably let you have. Most people will make a decision about choosing a realtor based on personality and how well they ""jive"" with the person, but that's the wrong answer. You want someone who no-kidding knows the local market and who can educate you. 

It's like working with a military recruiter. It's their JOB to put you in the military and that's the direction they're going to steer you. And of course the recruiter is gonna tell you all the awesome things about the military - they've reenlisted and stuck around a while. Doesn't mean it's for every applicant, and it's still the applicant's job to do their own research. Same thing with the realtor. 

Anyone can show you homes and point out how awesome a kitchen is. Anyone can give you a listing from the MLS. That's not what you want. You need someone who can no kidding educate you and be your advocate. 

Now you're faced with the decision to sell or rent after your PCS. Here's some thoughts:

**Selling expenses**

Look at your HUD/Closing statement from when you purchased the house, but look at the seller's side of the page. Assuming you sell the house for a similar amount as you purchased (within 10% or so), you can assume that selling closing costs will also be within about 10% of those listed on the closing statement. Normally, you can assume that 10-15% of the value of the sale will be eaten up in closing costs and realtor fees. This could vary based on the terms of your sales contract, but most buyers push the seller to pay as much as possible. So, if your home is worth $200,000, you can expect to take home $170,000 - $180,000 after closing costs. If you owe more than that, then YOU will have to write a check to the bank for the difference at closing. It you owed $185,000 on the $200,000 home, and your net was $180,000, then you pay the bank the extra $5000 to close. Decide if it's worth it to ""feed"" the home (more details later) month to month as a rental or if it's better to take the lump sum hit now. If you rolled your purchase closing costs into the loan, did a zero-down VA, or have not owned the home very long, look at the numbers closely. The home may have appreciated enough to cover everything, it may not have.

**Fair rental value**

Industry standard is 1% of the property's value each month as rent. This should (should) give you a pre-expense rate of return of 12% on your money before appreciation. However, that estimate is not accurate in every market. Work with your realtor or property manager to figure out a good price point to start at. I started a little bit high, then negotiated down to my bottom line. Price too high and you won't attract a tenant. Price too low and you'll attract the wrong kind of tenant. Factor in your own expenses, but if your expenses are high, you may have to ""feed"" the property (more on that later). Find out what houses near you are currently renting for, and get a good guestimate for what you could get for your home. Factor in any perks - like if the washer/dryer are included, if there's a pool, if you allow pets, etc. 

1% monthly works, sorta. In a high-rental but low-ownership neighborhood, rents may be more like 1.5% of the sale-able value. In a high value neighborhood, you're likely not going to get quite 1% as anyone who can afford $5000 a month rent on a half million dollar home will just buy the thing themselves.

**Rental expenses**

Here's what you need to factor in when estimating your monthly expenses:
 Mortgage payment
 Property tax increase (more below)
 Landlord's insurance (more below)
 Vacancies
 Turnover cost
 Repairs
 HOA fees
 Extras like lawn care or pool maintenance 

**Vacancies**

Industry standard is 8-10% time vacant, or about one month a year. Factor this into the price of your rent to maintain year-round profitability. You may have a year with 20% vacancy, and then your next tenant stays for 4 years. No telling what will happen. 1 vacant month each year is a generic estimate. 

**Turnover cost**

Regardless of how awesome your tenants are, there's going to be standard wear and tear on your property. Each turnover will require a deep clean New carpet and new paint will be required every 3-5 years, more often with kids/pets/smokers. If you're not physically able to do this work, you'll be paying out-of-pocket for a contractor to do this work, and it adds up fast (mine was $40 an hour). The longer this work takes, the longer your property is empty, and it's hard to show a house that's not in good condition. Some of the more egregious turnover problems can be taken out of the security deposit, but that could also be contested by the departing tenant. 

**Utilities during turnover**

The property owner is responsible for turning on the utilities while the home is vacant. It's very difficult to do turnover repairs without water or electricity, and almost impossible to show a home without electricity. Usually a phone call to the local utility company to re-open the utilities in your name is all it takes, but the utility company may require you leave a deposit with them. This is something your property manager can take care of for you if you're no longer in the local area. Factor this into your cost of turnover. 

**Repairs**

Industry standard is about 10% of the rent set aside for repairs - this number combines turnover repairs AND the day-to-day issues. This could vary widely, based on the condition of the home, price of the rent, standard of tenant, etc. The more expensive rent price attracts a more financially responsible tenant, who will either take better care of the home or be pickier about you repairing every little thing. Finding a responsible tenant who treats the property well and who does the little things themselves (I had a tenant who thought I owed him lightbulbs) will go a long way. 

**Listing fees**

The typical realtor who's listing your property for rent will take half the first month's rent as the listing fee. Half of that remains with the listing agent, and half goes to the tenant's agent. Factor this into your price of rent. Half the first month's rent, paid once a year (estimate, with 1-year leases turning over once a year), is about 4% of the annual rent cost. This is normally in addition to monthly management fees. 

**Management fees**

Usually 10% of the monthly rent in addition to the listing fees. Make sure you're getting your money's worth with this. If you've got a good tenant and can manage repair issues long-distance, you may only need to pay for listing fees. However, that leaves your property without an eyes-on look from someone other than a tenant, and that's not wise. Either way, find a good handyman in the area and keep them on speed dial. 

**HOAs**

Read your HOA docs and find out exactly what you need to do to rent the property. Your HOA may require board approval of your tenant. Get that process started early. If there's strict lawn care or other appearance standards, it may be beneficial to hire a lawn care company and just include it in the price of the rent. Be sure to list HOA standards in your rental contract and leave the tenant responsible for adhering to them. HOA fees are normally included in the rent so that you guarantee that they're paid. 

In a condo situation, FHA financing regulations require a certain percentage of the complex to be owner-occupied or the complex will not be eligible for typical financing. Without the ability to get FHA financing, the units will be less sell-able, and therefore will drop in value. In an effort to preserve the sale-ability and value of the entire complex, condo HOAs will deny requests to turn an owner-occupied unit into a rental IF the complex is close to that percentage. When purchasing a condo with the intent to rent in the future, ask the HOA about this. HOAs are also responsible for the maintenance of the parking lot, exterior structure, etc, and if the finances are poorly managed, it could result in an assessment against each unit. This is yet another financial contingency you must be ready for. 

In a typical single family home neighborhood, the management of the HOA can still make-or-break the rental situation. Do your research and talk to the board. 

**Pool**

A pool is easily $40,000+ worth of value in the home, and it's likely to your financial advantage to properly maintain it. Tenants may or may not care for it the way you would, you have to make the risk management decision. Consider hiring a pool maintenance company and include it in the price of the rent. One less thing for the tenant to worry about, and you've got the asset covered. Similar consideration should be made to AC system maintenance - just have the AC guy come once a year for a tune-up and add it to the pile of expenses. 

**Pets**

Your call on pets. Once pets live in the house, it's going to be hard to rent to non-pet owners unless you replace all the carpet. Pets can also kill the lawn and/or landscaping. I personally have pets and have had my own pets in my homes, so I've allowed my tenants to also have pets. You can attract a tenant who's willing to pay a bit more to have a good house with a good yard for their dogs. I always charge a non-refundable pet deposit, usually $250. That money will go towards cleaning or replacing the carpets or other damages directly from the pets. 

**Landlord's insurance**

You will need a new insurance policy on the property. A typical homeowners policy covers the home AND the contents, whereas a landlord's policy covers just the home. As the landlord's policy covers less, it's generally cheaper than the homeowners policy. However, if you had any challenges underwriting your home (pool, trampoline, closeness to the water, unpermitted work, etc) you'll have those same challenges underwriting a landlord's policy. 

**Property taxes**

Many states have a homestead exemption for a first home that's occupied by the owner. Once you rent out your home, you will lose the homestead exemption the following tax year. You will have an escrow deficiency that year (make it up in cash) and then a higher payment after that year's escrow analysis. Homestead exemption is typically $50,000 off the assessed value, so you can guestimate by adding that much to your value and then figuring out what the new taxes should be. For my house, it's about $1100 extra a year, or just shy of $100 a month. Make sure you include this in your rent pricing, and do careful research into the property tax laws of your county. 

**Cash flow break-even rent pricing**

Mortgage payment (including increased property taxes) , +10% management fee,
 +4% annual turnover,
 +10% expected repairs,
 +8% vacancy,
 +HOA fees,
 + extras (pool, lawn).
 I'm not factoring in pool or lawn expenses, as those are usually considered perks and added in afterwards. 

With a property manager: payment + 32%. Without a property manager: payment + 22%. Without a property manager and self-listing: payment + 18%

Now, take that number, and compare it to the typical market rents of houses near you. Can you cover your expenses? Break even? Come out ahead? Will you have to ""feed"" your home? If so, how much? 

**Feeding the home**

Feeding the home is when you're spending more in expenses monthly/yearly than you're making in rent. Sometimes this is due to a catastrophic repair event, sometimes this is due to market fluctuation. Sometimes this is due to over-leveraging in your financing (zero down loan) and a high interest cost. Whatever the reason, you need to make a risk calculation to decide to continue feeding the property extra money or to just cut your losses and sell the house. Here's a few ways to look at it. 

First, calculate your expected net loss at closing if you were to sell the property. Next, calculate how much you'd have to ""feed"" it monthly. Compare the two and find out your break even point. If you're looking at a $5,000 loss at closing, but only feeding the house $200 a month, your break even point is 25 months, or 2 years. In that 2 years, your property values can go up, your cost of ownership can go down (mostly your monthly interest cost), and market rents may increase. So, 2 years from now, calculate if it's worth it to continue keeping the property and move on from there. If you're feeding it $100 a month in contrast to a potential $20,000 loss, feeding it is likely the way to go. If you're feeding it $500 monthly while looking at a $2000 closing loss, you're probably better off to just sell it and move on. 

As you pay down the house, your equity increases and the cost of ownership decreases. Your return rates will therefore increase. If your monthly mortgage pay-off amount is around $450, but your feeding the house $200, your cash flow will show that you're losing $200 monthly, but your network has an overall gain of $250 monthly. This can be a fantastic long-term strategy, if you've got the finances and budget to sustain it in the short term. 

Catastrophic repair events happen, too, but these can increase the value of the property. For example, a new AC system may be $7000, but you'll get that money back when you sell it. Its a factor in planning, but not really a month to month expense. More on that later. 

Granted, all of these numbers are looked at before the emotional factor of personal finance is considered. If it's worth it to you to spend $200 a month to keep your dream home for 2 more years until retirement, then that's an emotional decision. A perfectly reasonable one to make, if that's what you want to do. Just factor everything in together when looking at the big picture. 

**Tenant screening**

Obviously, selecting good tenants is key to maintaining a good rental relationship. I had tenants who ended up growing pot in my house and cost me a significant amount of money. Renting to military families is also hit or miss, I've had fantastic military families in my homes and challenging military families in my homes. Even if you list the property yourself, run a full background check and look at their financial ability to pay you. I don't pay too much attention to their credit score (unless there's a glaring problem), but do look at their ability to PAY their rent on time. 

**Managing the tenant relationship**

There's another person living in my largest financial asset. I try my best to be open and accessible, without getting too buddy-buddy. If there's an issue with the house that falls on the landlord's responsiblity, I've tried to err on the side of the tenant. For example, the month that my tenants had to heat their house with their stove while we installed a replacement HVAC system, I covered their natural gas bill. With good tenants, the good will generally pays off quite well. 

**Income Taxes**

You will pay income taxes on your rental profit. That's after deducting your expenses. Rental property expenses are not deducted in the same way as your primary mortgage interest - that's the difference between taking the standard deduction and itemizing. I normally take the standard deduction, as I don't have personal expenses worth itemizing. However, your rental property is treated like a small business and rental expenses will count against your rental income to get the bottom line.

The following expenses are deductible: Insurance, interest, property taxes, utilities, listing fees, management fees, HOA fees, repairs. You can also take depreciation (more later on that.) Upgrades and capital improvements are not deductible, but can be straight-line depreciated (I've never done this myself.) If, say, the roof goes bad and you spend $10,000 on a new roof, that's deductible. If you ADD on a deck, that's considered an improvement. 

The main out-of-pocket expense that you can't deduct is the principle part of your mortgage payment, as that's not an actual expense. That money still go towards increasing your net worth by increasing your equity in the property. 

I do my own taxes every year with the $79.99 version of TurboTax and a few hours worth of research. Good record keeping during the year is essential, especially when adding up all of those Lowes receipts for repairs. 

**Depreciation**

Oh, boy... Depreciation is the idea that an asset has a limited lifespan, and after a certain amount of time, the asset will be worth zero. The IRS allows you to take a fraction of that every year, and consider it an expense against your income. (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060815/how-rental-property-depreciation-works.asp) Taking depreciation will reduce your income taxes, however, you will pay capital gains taxes on the depreciated amount when you go to sell the property. 

With long term capital gains set at 15% (for most people), chances are that you're better off taking the depreciation if your current marginal (not effective) tax rate is above 15%. There's no telling what tax rates will do in the future, though. If/when you sell the property, hopefully you'll have the cash available to pay the taxes at that time. 

Depreciation can be compared to the tax advantages of a retirement account. It's is more like the Traditional instead of the Roth, where you take the tax break now but pay for it later. 

When you sell the property (either because you wanted to or because you're dead and the estate is selling it), the capital gains taxes are paid as follows: Net of sale (market rate minus selling expenses), minus original purchase price, plus depreciation taken. 

If the house purchased for $100,000, depreciation will be around $3000 a year. Letssay, 4 years in, you've depreciated the house by $12,000. Your basis in the home is now $88,000, NOT the original $100,000. You sell it for $150,000, net $127,500 (15% of $150,000). $127,500 - $88,000 = taxable gains of $39,500 x 15% = taxes of $5925. Without depreciation, the taxable gains would have been $27,500 and taxes of $3300.

**The emotional factor of landlording**

My husband and I rented out our first home after we upgraded to a larger one. A few months later, he was at the home fixing a minor issue and saw how our tenant was taking care of the property. The place was dirty, smelled bad, and overall not well kept (bad tenant screening on my end). This was OUR home, the home we brought out daughter home from the hospital to, the home that we shared our wedding night in. Seeing it treated poorly by a stranger was a punch in the gut. No amount of money was worth seeing our memories misstreated like that. 

Or is it? You're going to have to decide what your emotional investment into the property is and if you can allow it to become someone else's home. This isn't a financial decision as much as it is a personal one. The personal influence can cause you to make a less than optimal financial decision concerning the property, so just keep that awareness as you make those critical decisions. 

**Internal financial management**

Per most states' state law, rental security deposits must not be commingled with other monies. I keep a separate savings account with the security deposit and just don't touch it. Any interest that the deposit accrues is owed back to the tenant at the time that they move out. 

I have a separate checking account for my property. Rents are paid in, expenses paid out. That way, everything is in ONE location and it's easy to figure out exactly what our profit/loss is. If you're managing a property locally, get a debit card on that account for Lowes purchases. I also keep a savings account for each property for escrow and repairs. (one property is paid for, so I maintain a manual escrow account, the other is a straight emergency fund.) 

I structure my personal budget to pay my mortgages and rental expenses out of our base pay, and then use the rents to put money into retirement, savings, and my daughter's college fund. That way, if (when) there's a vacancy or a problem, I'm not coming out in the red during those months. We can at least cover our expenses on our base pay, even if there's a month or two where we don't quite get to retirement contributions. 

In addition to emergency funds set aside directly for the property, make sure you can handle the one-off catastrophic emergency. 

**Catastrophic emergency**

Last year, I lost $22,000 in rental real estate, between rehabbing my first home, fixing up the second, recovering from crappy tenants in the second, and worse. The city hit my sewer main, said it was my fault, and I was out $10,000 in a single month. 3 years ago, the heater in my first house went out in December, and I wrote a check for $7000. I currently have $16,000 invested in 3 different sewer main re-builds under two different houses. (never, EVER again buying anything with cast iron pipes.) These things happen, and we dealt with all of this on SSgt pay. Thankfully, most of those losses have been made up over the next 1-2 years' worth of rent, but you NEED to have the cash on hand to be able to cover these types of emergencies. Good credit is also helpful - I had to borrow $10,000 once to cover turnover and repairs, but ended up coming out on top in the end. Ultimately, your rental property is likely a significant chunk of your net worth, and while it may hurt to spend ten grand on a repair issue, that's only 5% of the value of a $200,000 home. Not worth losing a whole asset over 5%. 

**The hassle factor**

Landlording is not easy. Dealing with people, finances, local real estate markets, construction type repairs, etc. It's a package deal. Some months I spend 30 minutes on it and make a decent amount of money. Some months it's 30 hours a week and I lose money. Overall, I've done pretty well, but it's the law of averages. 

Purchasing the next home with a rental

SOOOO... you're on the brink, ready to rent out your current house and go buy another one. Here's some things to think about: 

**Financing considerations**

So, you've PCSed and now want to buy a new house at your next duty station. That's great, now you need to convince a loan officer to give you another mortgage for another property.

First, you're going to have to be able to afford a second mortgage with your current debt to income ratio. If your rental mortgage is all the debt you have, you're probably in a good spot. Add in some vehicle or student loan debt, and now it doesnt look too good. 

You can use you rental income to compensate for the rental mortgage, but the bank will want to see 2 years tax returns with the income. Depending on when you converted it to a rental and what time a year you want to buy, 2 years tax returns can take closer to parts of 4 years to document. 

**Purchase conservatively**

The bank will do all they can to max out your DTI (debt to income ratio) to earn just as much interest off of you as they can. By choosing a smaller/cheaper home for your initial or second purchases, you can reign in the budget. Think of who you're going to rent to when you PCS, and make sure you can afford to rent within BAH rates. Just because the bank says you can borrow a half million dollars on a mortgage doesn't mean you should. And if you do, you will have zero room to finance the next property. Scroll back to the top where we talked about not over-buying. 

**Leverage ratios**

Alright, heading into the weeds here... The more you've borrowed against a property, the higher the leverage ratio. This isn't generally a problem if you're living in your own home and plan to remain there for quite some time, but it does become a factor when the bank starts looking at your suitability for the next purchase. (https://www.thebalancesmb.com/top-don-ts-in-using-real-estate-leverage-2867098) 

If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $100,000, your leverage ratio is .90, that's very high. If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $400,000, your leverage ratio is now 0.225. That's very conservative. With the same debt to income ratio, the real estate owner with the lower leverage ratio is going to be a much safer customer to the bank. You can better your leverage ratios by 1, paying down the house or 2, letting it appreciate. The first is within your control, the second is not. 

**Interest expense**

The single greatest expense in the first year of home ownership is the purchaser's closing costs. Beyond the first year, the greatest expense on a financed property (barring an enormous catastrophic event) is the interest expense. The lower your interest expense, the higher your profit. You can lower your interest expense by 1, getting a better rate and 2, borrowing less. You can borrow less by either putting more down on the home, or by paying it down early. 

**Paying off a house early**

So, this one is highly controversial in the landlord business. Some folks will say to borrow as much as possible against a rental property because the interest is completely tax deductible and you can leverage your cash to purchase multiple properties. It's also possible (some years) to make a better rate of return in the stock market. While both of these schools of thought have validity, it's overlooking the factor of RISK. I've personally paid off a rental property and it was one of the greatest feelings in the world. Sure, I'm not making quite as much on that money as I could, but the risk on a paid for property is much lower than with a financed property. It also doesn't count towards my DTI any more, and isn't much of a hassle factor in future property financing decisions. At a minimum, paying off the house will give you a return equal to the interest rate, minus the marginal taxes you would have paid if you had taken the deduction. However, if you achieved a greater rate of return elsewhere, you'd also owe taxes on that, at either capital gains rates or your personal marginal tax rate. 

If your goal is to churn and burn and just buy as many properties as possible, you're likely going to finance all of them as much as you can. If your goal is to retire from the military with one or two investment properties, then work towards paying them off at a reasonable rate. 

**Conventional VS creative financing**

Creative financing is an option, but not one that most of us use. This would be something like, say, getting a loan from your uncle's IRA to buy the house, and then you pay your uncle the interest. This is do-able if you've got rich friends/family who are willing to invest in your mortgage. However, loans like this require much more documentation when you're looking at the next deal. Because banks are used to dealing with conforming loans (the fancy term for loans that fit all the rules), they may balk at a lender with a creatively financed asset in their portfolio. You'll have a greater burden of paperwork and proof to demonstrate your continued creditworthiness. 

**Rental VS Owner occupied financing**

You can borrow money to purchase a rental, but the interest rates are usually a full or two full percentage points higher. On $100,000 borrowed, each full interest rate percentage is $1000 a year or $83 a month. Obviously, that amortizes, but that's the starting expense at month 1. 

**Refinancing a rental as a rental**

Once the home is no longer owner occupied, it doesn't fit the criteria for owner occupied financing. A re-finance at that point (to pull cash out, clear the VA entitlement, or re-structure of payments) will likely cost that $83 per month per $100,000 borrowed. If you live in a home that will be a rental and you need to update your financing, do it before you move out. 

**Larger down payment**

You can always entice a bank with a larger down payment. The more money you put down on the next deal, the lower their risk is. Borrowing less also raises your DTI by a smaller amount, and that can help get you approved. Coming up with a larger down payment while turning your current property AND PCSing can be challenging, so plan ahead. 

Here's another thing to think about with the down payment: Your down payment is your buffer between you and the real estate market fluctuating. If you have 5% equity in your house, and the market drops by 5%, you're basically imobile. If you have 25% equity and the market drops 5%, you're still down by that much of your net worth, but the remaining 20% equity gives you the ability to cover closing costs if you choose to sell, cover a dip in rents, etc. Better to lose money you have than money you don't. 

Let me say that again - Better to lose money you have, than money you don't.

**Balanced portfolio**

Guys, rental real estate isn't the whole thing. For the average homeowner, our home makes up the largest asset in our portfolio. If the house is paid for, it's probably the most significant portion of our net worth. As soon as it's rented, you now have one single asset worth a LOT of money, and all of your net worth is in the same asset class. 

Don't forget to contribute to retirement through tax advantaged accounts (IRAs, TSP, 401Ks, etc). There's been seasons in our life where we had to stop retirement contributions to get over a hump, but that should be the exception, not the norm. Do your own research if your rental property income changes the equation for you while deciding between Roth and Traditional contributions, but chances are, it shouldn't make that big of a difference. 

**Liquidity**

This is a problem, too. $100,000 worth of home may be worth $100,000, but it's very difficult to convert a house that another family is living in, into cash. Borrowing against the property is an option, but only if your DTI can support it. Selling the property, at a minimum, will take 60 days. Maintain the amount of liquidity in your overall net worth (mine is in my emergency fund) to balance the amount that's non-liquid. Your personal liquidity needs are dependent on your financial situation and your risk tolerance, but it is a factor to consider. 

If I missed anything... ask, and I'll find an answer. Hope this is helpful to someone here.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an active member of this sub, but grabbed a new account to post this, as there&amp;#39;s a few too many personal details. This was originally written for &lt;a href=""/r/airforce""&gt;r/airforce&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;#39;s from a military perspective, but I figured you guys would might like to read it, too. PCS/PCSing = permanent change of station, or when we move from one base to another. BAH = basic allowance for housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Rental real estate is a pain, but can be very lucrative if done right. Here&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of things you might need to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Alrighty, I&amp;#39;m wrong about depreciation. Depreciation is still a thing, still affects your personal income taxes, but I&amp;#39;m heading right back to google to correct my own information. Guys, I wrote this whole thing off the top of my head based on what I have personally learned, and I sincerely apologize, I don&amp;#39;t mean to be handing out bad advice. Looks like I personally need to learn a whole bunch more about how depreciation recapture works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: The VA and FHA loans &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be good options. However, YOU need to shop all of your options. Do not just assume that the VA is the best way to go. If it is the best option for you, go for it. If not, go with other financing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: I&amp;#39;m pretty risk averse when it comes to over-leveraging. I&amp;#39;m never going to suggest that someone buy a house with nothing down, especially not while in the military and subject to a short notice relocation. If you do your own research and choose to buy with nothing down, that&amp;#39;s on you. I&amp;#39;m still not comfortable with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright... wall of text coming in. Take what you can and leave what&amp;#39;s not useful. Everything written here is what I&amp;#39;ve personally learned. I&amp;#39;m not a realtor or a professional property manager, but have been a landlord for 6+ years and have learned a lot. Most of those lessons learned had huge price tags on them, too. I purchased my first home in 2011, our second in 2014, and our third just last year. The first two are rented out. Not everything will apply to you, but here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve learned along the way. Topics are written in the order that I thought of them, my apologies if it&amp;#39;s not 100% cohesive. As of right now, I have awesome tenants in both properties, but that hasn&amp;#39;t always been the case. My approach to real estate is to 1, protect my own investment and 2, to provide a good home to my tenants. I&amp;#39;ve made some more generous financial decisions to both of those extents, and while those decisions cut into my profits a bit, I have no regrets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchasing your first home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I rent or purchase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t over buy on your first purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say again, don&amp;#39;t over buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the market is white hot, it&amp;#39;s going to cool off. And you don&amp;#39;t want to be holding the chips when that happens. You really don&amp;#39;t have the time to sit on the house and let it recover, unless you&amp;#39;ve got money somewhere you&amp;#39;re not talking about. 2008 took about 10 years to fully recover from and to gain back the lost appreciation (most markets, at least) and you don&amp;#39;t have 10 years. ​ If you do a zero down VA loan and roll the closing costs into the loan, it takes, on average, the first 18 months just to pay off the closing costs. Takes about 3 more years to get down to a break-even point with seller&amp;#39;s closing costs included, and about 5 years before you&amp;#39;ll make money. Yes, it seems like a lot of BAH to be &amp;quot;throwing away&amp;quot;, but look at the actual makeup of a newly amortized mortgage - most of your payment is going towards things other than principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you bring a down payment to the table, you&amp;#39;ve mitigated that part of your risk, but you&amp;#39;re still exposed to lose money at the sale of the house. You&amp;#39;ve still got your purchase closing costs, which, on a $190k house are probably between $6000 and $9000, depending on your financing. Most of that is money that just evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can rent for LESS than the interest/insurance/taxes part of the payment and just dump the principal part into savings/mutual funds/TSP/IRA, you&amp;#39;ll come out ahead. Granted, that normally means renting a smaller apartment instead of living in a nice house, but it&amp;#39;s the sacrifice we make to be financially responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money in real estate is made 3 ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1, getting a good deal on the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2, holding the property for forever and getting the appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3, renting it out and making a profit off of someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, you want a good mix of all 3. The first takes PATIENCE when you&amp;#39;re looking to purchase, and from what you&amp;#39;ve told me, a good deal just isn&amp;#39;t available to purchase in Vegas right now. Strike one. Are you going to live in it long enough to ride out the bubble you see and make money when you sell? Meh, maybe not. Strike two. Do you want to landlord? If you&amp;#39;ve thought about it, scroll up and re-read again. If you&amp;#39;re still on board, then its a consideration ​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renting is buying patience. Seems like in your area, patience is what you need. There&amp;#39;s always a house to buy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rents do rise and fall, but they don&amp;#39;t rise and fall nearly as fast as real estate does in a white-hot market. Hence the 1% per month rental price as an approximation. If there&amp;#39;s a $200,000 house that&amp;#39;s renting for $1500 a month, and the house next door sells for $220,000, the first house likely went up 10% in value. However, your landlord isn&amp;#39;t going to jack your rent 10% in the middle of the lease just because Zillow thinks his house is now worth what the one next door sold for. If you rent, you&amp;#39;re protected from the competitive spikes in purchasing, and are more exposed to the long-term appreciation of pricing. Your landlord&amp;#39;s costs of ownership are fixed (unless he&amp;#39;s on an interest only loan, and then he&amp;#39;s stupid), so he can offer you rent at a fixed or gradually increasing rate. He&amp;#39;s not trying to compete with other buyers to purchase a first home like you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VA Loan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VA loan... not my favorite topic. First off, you&amp;#39;re almost always better off going with conventional financing if you&amp;#39;ve got a down payment, and no one should ever purchase a home if they don&amp;#39;t have one. The VA loan brags about not having PMI, but the funding fee is essentially pre-paid PMI. On a conventional loan, you can request that PMI be removed once you hit 78% LTV, but there&amp;#39;s no option to un-do the prepayment of the funding fee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time the VA loan is used, the funding fee is 2.15% of the loan. After that, it&amp;#39;s 3.3% of the loan unless the borrower brings 5% down. (&lt;a href=""https://www.veteransunited.com/education/library/va-funding-fee/""&gt;https://www.veteransunited.com/education/library/va-funding-fee/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The max amount of loan that the VA will insure is $453,000. You can have more than one VA loan at a time, but the two can NOT total more than that amount. With the median home price today, you&amp;#39;re likely going to be going with conventional financing on the next house, anyway. The other option is to refinance the soon to be rental with conventional financing and re-use the VA entitlement on the new purchase, but again, I tend to shy away from VA loans all together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I purchased my last home, my loan officer just assumed that I&amp;#39;d go with VA financing. I asked her to pull a quote for conventional and give me the break-even point. She didn&amp;#39;t want to, but I made her do it anyway. She was shocked that, wow, I was right about my financing options. Not to brag, but she&amp;#39;s used to checking boxes on paperwork, while I&amp;#39;m used to scrimping to make that precious SSgt pay last as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m buying near a military base, it&amp;#39;s a good market, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but buying close to base is BAD for appreciation. Because of the high turnover of military personal, there&amp;#39;s always someone trying to sell their house. Always a lot of people, actually. This leads to high inventory and low demand. When there&amp;#39;s high inventory, people start dropping prices to sell faster. You&amp;#39;ve seen the opposite right now in Vegas - low inventory and high demand cause a price spike. Same math, different side of the equation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With values depressed because of high inventory, sellers in a heavily military area will likely sell for their break-even point. If sales prices don&amp;#39;t go up, neither does value. Neither does rents, and so BAH remains flat. BAH remains flat, and the next guy can&amp;#39;t afford to buy your house for any more than you bought it for. It&amp;#39;s a vicious cycle and it&amp;#39;s common near bases. In this equation, the only people making any money are the real estate agents who have an unlimited supply of customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plus side is that you can usually get a lot of house for the money near a base. The only real way to break that cycle is to have an outside economic influence bleeding off the extra inventory. This happens when a small(ish) base is located in an area with other good paying jobs. If the only places to work in a 20 minute radius are the base and retail, tread carefully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working with a realtor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realtors are real estate professionals, and I always recommend a first time buyer work with a good agent. However, keep in mind that the realtor has a vested interest in you purchasing just as much home as you can. Same thing with the bank, they WANT you to borrow as much as they can reasonably let you have. Most people will make a decision about choosing a realtor based on personality and how well they &amp;quot;jive&amp;quot; with the person, but that&amp;#39;s the wrong answer. You want someone who no-kidding knows the local market and who can educate you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like working with a military recruiter. It&amp;#39;s their JOB to put you in the military and that&amp;#39;s the direction they&amp;#39;re going to steer you. And of course the recruiter is gonna tell you all the awesome things about the military - they&amp;#39;ve reenlisted and stuck around a while. Doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s for every applicant, and it&amp;#39;s still the applicant&amp;#39;s job to do their own research. Same thing with the realtor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can show you homes and point out how awesome a kitchen is. Anyone can give you a listing from the MLS. That&amp;#39;s not what you want. You need someone who can no kidding educate you and be your advocate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;#39;re faced with the decision to sell or rent after your PCS. Here&amp;#39;s some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at your HUD/Closing statement from when you purchased the house, but look at the seller&amp;#39;s side of the page. Assuming you sell the house for a similar amount as you purchased (within 10% or so), you can assume that selling closing costs will also be within about 10% of those listed on the closing statement. Normally, you can assume that 10-15% of the value of the sale will be eaten up in closing costs and realtor fees. This could vary based on the terms of your sales contract, but most buyers push the seller to pay as much as possible. So, if your home is worth $200,000, you can expect to take home $170,000 - $180,000 after closing costs. If you owe more than that, then YOU will have to write a check to the bank for the difference at closing. It you owed $185,000 on the $200,000 home, and your net was $180,000, then you pay the bank the extra $5000 to close. Decide if it&amp;#39;s worth it to &amp;quot;feed&amp;quot; the home (more details later) month to month as a rental or if it&amp;#39;s better to take the lump sum hit now. If you rolled your purchase closing costs into the loan, did a zero-down VA, or have not owned the home very long, look at the numbers closely. The home may have appreciated enough to cover everything, it may not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair rental value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry standard is 1% of the property&amp;#39;s value each month as rent. This should (should) give you a pre-expense rate of return of 12% on your money before appreciation. However, that estimate is not accurate in every market. Work with your realtor or property manager to figure out a good price point to start at. I started a little bit high, then negotiated down to my bottom line. Price too high and you won&amp;#39;t attract a tenant. Price too low and you&amp;#39;ll attract the wrong kind of tenant. Factor in your own expenses, but if your expenses are high, you may have to &amp;quot;feed&amp;quot; the property (more on that later). Find out what houses near you are currently renting for, and get a good guestimate for what you could get for your home. Factor in any perks - like if the washer/dryer are included, if there&amp;#39;s a pool, if you allow pets, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1% monthly works, sorta. In a high-rental but low-ownership neighborhood, rents may be more like 1.5% of the sale-able value. In a high value neighborhood, you&amp;#39;re likely not going to get quite 1% as anyone who can afford $5000 a month rent on a half million dollar home will just buy the thing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rental expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what you need to factor in when estimating your monthly expenses:
 Mortgage payment
 Property tax increase (more below)
 Landlord&amp;#39;s insurance (more below)
 Vacancies
 Turnover cost
 Repairs
 HOA fees
 Extras like lawn care or pool maintenance &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vacancies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry standard is 8-10% time vacant, or about one month a year. Factor this into the price of your rent to maintain year-round profitability. You may have a year with 20% vacancy, and then your next tenant stays for 4 years. No telling what will happen. 1 vacant month each year is a generic estimate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turnover cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how awesome your tenants are, there&amp;#39;s going to be standard wear and tear on your property. Each turnover will require a deep clean New carpet and new paint will be required every 3-5 years, more often with kids/pets/smokers. If you&amp;#39;re not physically able to do this work, you&amp;#39;ll be paying out-of-pocket for a contractor to do this work, and it adds up fast (mine was $40 an hour). The longer this work takes, the longer your property is empty, and it&amp;#39;s hard to show a house that&amp;#39;s not in good condition. Some of the more egregious turnover problems can be taken out of the security deposit, but that could also be contested by the departing tenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilities during turnover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The property owner is responsible for turning on the utilities while the home is vacant. It&amp;#39;s very difficult to do turnover repairs without water or electricity, and almost impossible to show a home without electricity. Usually a phone call to the local utility company to re-open the utilities in your name is all it takes, but the utility company may require you leave a deposit with them. This is something your property manager can take care of for you if you&amp;#39;re no longer in the local area. Factor this into your cost of turnover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry standard is about 10% of the rent set aside for repairs - this number combines turnover repairs AND the day-to-day issues. This could vary widely, based on the condition of the home, price of the rent, standard of tenant, etc. The more expensive rent price attracts a more financially responsible tenant, who will either take better care of the home or be pickier about you repairing every little thing. Finding a responsible tenant who treats the property well and who does the little things themselves (I had a tenant who thought I owed him lightbulbs) will go a long way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listing fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical realtor who&amp;#39;s listing your property for rent will take half the first month&amp;#39;s rent as the listing fee. Half of that remains with the listing agent, and half goes to the tenant&amp;#39;s agent. Factor this into your price of rent. Half the first month&amp;#39;s rent, paid once a year (estimate, with 1-year leases turning over once a year), is about 4% of the annual rent cost. This is normally in addition to monthly management fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually 10% of the monthly rent in addition to the listing fees. Make sure you&amp;#39;re getting your money&amp;#39;s worth with this. If you&amp;#39;ve got a good tenant and can manage repair issues long-distance, you may only need to pay for listing fees. However, that leaves your property without an eyes-on look from someone other than a tenant, and that&amp;#39;s not wise. Either way, find a good handyman in the area and keep them on speed dial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOAs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read your HOA docs and find out exactly what you need to do to rent the property. Your HOA may require board approval of your tenant. Get that process started early. If there&amp;#39;s strict lawn care or other appearance standards, it may be beneficial to hire a lawn care company and just include it in the price of the rent. Be sure to list HOA standards in your rental contract and leave the tenant responsible for adhering to them. HOA fees are normally included in the rent so that you guarantee that they&amp;#39;re paid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a condo situation, FHA financing regulations require a certain percentage of the complex to be owner-occupied or the complex will not be eligible for typical financing. Without the ability to get FHA financing, the units will be less sell-able, and therefore will drop in value. In an effort to preserve the sale-ability and value of the entire complex, condo HOAs will deny requests to turn an owner-occupied unit into a rental IF the complex is close to that percentage. When purchasing a condo with the intent to rent in the future, ask the HOA about this. HOAs are also responsible for the maintenance of the parking lot, exterior structure, etc, and if the finances are poorly managed, it could result in an assessment against each unit. This is yet another financial contingency you must be ready for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a typical single family home neighborhood, the management of the HOA can still make-or-break the rental situation. Do your research and talk to the board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pool is easily $40,000+ worth of value in the home, and it&amp;#39;s likely to your financial advantage to properly maintain it. Tenants may or may not care for it the way you would, you have to make the risk management decision. Consider hiring a pool maintenance company and include it in the price of the rent. One less thing for the tenant to worry about, and you&amp;#39;ve got the asset covered. Similar consideration should be made to AC system maintenance - just have the AC guy come once a year for a tune-up and add it to the pile of expenses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your call on pets. Once pets live in the house, it&amp;#39;s going to be hard to rent to non-pet owners unless you replace all the carpet. Pets can also kill the lawn and/or landscaping. I personally have pets and have had my own pets in my homes, so I&amp;#39;ve allowed my tenants to also have pets. You can attract a tenant who&amp;#39;s willing to pay a bit more to have a good house with a good yard for their dogs. I always charge a non-refundable pet deposit, usually $250. That money will go towards cleaning or replacing the carpets or other damages directly from the pets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landlord&amp;#39;s insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need a new insurance policy on the property. A typical homeowners policy covers the home AND the contents, whereas a landlord&amp;#39;s policy covers just the home. As the landlord&amp;#39;s policy covers less, it&amp;#39;s generally cheaper than the homeowners policy. However, if you had any challenges underwriting your home (pool, trampoline, closeness to the water, unpermitted work, etc) you&amp;#39;ll have those same challenges underwriting a landlord&amp;#39;s policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many states have a homestead exemption for a first home that&amp;#39;s occupied by the owner. Once you rent out your home, you will lose the homestead exemption the following tax year. You will have an escrow deficiency that year (make it up in cash) and then a higher payment after that year&amp;#39;s escrow analysis. Homestead exemption is typically $50,000 off the assessed value, so you can guestimate by adding that much to your value and then figuring out what the new taxes should be. For my house, it&amp;#39;s about $1100 extra a year, or just shy of $100 a month. Make sure you include this in your rent pricing, and do careful research into the property tax laws of your county. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash flow break-even rent pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mortgage payment (including increased property taxes) , +10% management fee,
 +4% annual turnover,
 +10% expected repairs,
 +8% vacancy,
 +HOA fees,
 + extras (pool, lawn).
 I&amp;#39;m not factoring in pool or lawn expenses, as those are usually considered perks and added in afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a property manager: payment + 32%. Without a property manager: payment + 22%. Without a property manager and self-listing: payment + 18%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, take that number, and compare it to the typical market rents of houses near you. Can you cover your expenses? Break even? Come out ahead? Will you have to &amp;quot;feed&amp;quot; your home? If so, how much? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeding the home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding the home is when you&amp;#39;re spending more in expenses monthly/yearly than you&amp;#39;re making in rent. Sometimes this is due to a catastrophic repair event, sometimes this is due to market fluctuation. Sometimes this is due to over-leveraging in your financing (zero down loan) and a high interest cost. Whatever the reason, you need to make a risk calculation to decide to continue feeding the property extra money or to just cut your losses and sell the house. Here&amp;#39;s a few ways to look at it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, calculate your expected net loss at closing if you were to sell the property. Next, calculate how much you&amp;#39;d have to &amp;quot;feed&amp;quot; it monthly. Compare the two and find out your break even point. If you&amp;#39;re looking at a $5,000 loss at closing, but only feeding the house $200 a month, your break even point is 25 months, or 2 years. In that 2 years, your property values can go up, your cost of ownership can go down (mostly your monthly interest cost), and market rents may increase. So, 2 years from now, calculate if it&amp;#39;s worth it to continue keeping the property and move on from there. If you&amp;#39;re feeding it $100 a month in contrast to a potential $20,000 loss, feeding it is likely the way to go. If you&amp;#39;re feeding it $500 monthly while looking at a $2000 closing loss, you&amp;#39;re probably better off to just sell it and move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you pay down the house, your equity increases and the cost of ownership decreases. Your return rates will therefore increase. If your monthly mortgage pay-off amount is around $450, but your feeding the house $200, your cash flow will show that you&amp;#39;re losing $200 monthly, but your network has an overall gain of $250 monthly. This can be a fantastic long-term strategy, if you&amp;#39;ve got the finances and budget to sustain it in the short term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catastrophic repair events happen, too, but these can increase the value of the property. For example, a new AC system may be $7000, but you&amp;#39;ll get that money back when you sell it. Its a factor in planning, but not really a month to month expense. More on that later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, all of these numbers are looked at before the emotional factor of personal finance is considered. If it&amp;#39;s worth it to you to spend $200 a month to keep your dream home for 2 more years until retirement, then that&amp;#39;s an emotional decision. A perfectly reasonable one to make, if that&amp;#39;s what you want to do. Just factor everything in together when looking at the big picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenant screening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, selecting good tenants is key to maintaining a good rental relationship. I had tenants who ended up growing pot in my house and cost me a significant amount of money. Renting to military families is also hit or miss, I&amp;#39;ve had fantastic military families in my homes and challenging military families in my homes. Even if you list the property yourself, run a full background check and look at their financial ability to pay you. I don&amp;#39;t pay too much attention to their credit score (unless there&amp;#39;s a glaring problem), but do look at their ability to PAY their rent on time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the tenant relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another person living in my largest financial asset. I try my best to be open and accessible, without getting too buddy-buddy. If there&amp;#39;s an issue with the house that falls on the landlord&amp;#39;s responsiblity, I&amp;#39;ve tried to err on the side of the tenant. For example, the month that my tenants had to heat their house with their stove while we installed a replacement HVAC system, I covered their natural gas bill. With good tenants, the good will generally pays off quite well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income Taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will pay income taxes on your rental profit. That&amp;#39;s after deducting your expenses. Rental property expenses are not deducted in the same way as your primary mortgage interest - that&amp;#39;s the difference between taking the standard deduction and itemizing. I normally take the standard deduction, as I don&amp;#39;t have personal expenses worth itemizing. However, your rental property is treated like a small business and rental expenses will count against your rental income to get the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following expenses are deductible: Insurance, interest, property taxes, utilities, listing fees, management fees, HOA fees, repairs. You can also take depreciation (more later on that.) Upgrades and capital improvements are not deductible, but can be straight-line depreciated (I&amp;#39;ve never done this myself.) If, say, the roof goes bad and you spend $10,000 on a new roof, that&amp;#39;s deductible. If you ADD on a deck, that&amp;#39;s considered an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main out-of-pocket expense that you can&amp;#39;t deduct is the principle part of your mortgage payment, as that&amp;#39;s not an actual expense. That money still go towards increasing your net worth by increasing your equity in the property. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do my own taxes every year with the $79.99 version of TurboTax and a few hours worth of research. Good record keeping during the year is essential, especially when adding up all of those Lowes receipts for repairs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depreciation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, boy... Depreciation is the idea that an asset has a limited lifespan, and after a certain amount of time, the asset will be worth zero. The IRS allows you to take a fraction of that every year, and consider it an expense against your income. (&lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060815/how-rental-property-depreciation-works.asp""&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060815/how-rental-property-depreciation-works.asp&lt;/a&gt;) Taking depreciation will reduce your income taxes, however, you will pay capital gains taxes on the depreciated amount when you go to sell the property. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With long term capital gains set at 15% (for most people), chances are that you&amp;#39;re better off taking the depreciation if your current marginal (not effective) tax rate is above 15%. There&amp;#39;s no telling what tax rates will do in the future, though. If/when you sell the property, hopefully you&amp;#39;ll have the cash available to pay the taxes at that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depreciation can be compared to the tax advantages of a retirement account. It&amp;#39;s is more like the Traditional instead of the Roth, where you take the tax break now but pay for it later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sell the property (either because you wanted to or because you&amp;#39;re dead and the estate is selling it), the capital gains taxes are paid as follows: Net of sale (market rate minus selling expenses), minus original purchase price, plus depreciation taken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the house purchased for $100,000, depreciation will be around $3000 a year. Letssay, 4 years in, you&amp;#39;ve depreciated the house by $12,000. Your basis in the home is now $88,000, NOT the original $100,000. You sell it for $150,000, net $127,500 (15% of $150,000). $127,500 - $88,000 = taxable gains of $39,500 x 15% = taxes of $5925. Without depreciation, the taxable gains would have been $27,500 and taxes of $3300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emotional factor of landlording&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I rented out our first home after we upgraded to a larger one. A few months later, he was at the home fixing a minor issue and saw how our tenant was taking care of the property. The place was dirty, smelled bad, and overall not well kept (bad tenant screening on my end). This was OUR home, the home we brought out daughter home from the hospital to, the home that we shared our wedding night in. Seeing it treated poorly by a stranger was a punch in the gut. No amount of money was worth seeing our memories misstreated like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it? You&amp;#39;re going to have to decide what your emotional investment into the property is and if you can allow it to become someone else&amp;#39;s home. This isn&amp;#39;t a financial decision as much as it is a personal one. The personal influence can cause you to make a less than optimal financial decision concerning the property, so just keep that awareness as you make those critical decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal financial management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per most states&amp;#39; state law, rental security deposits must not be commingled with other monies. I keep a separate savings account with the security deposit and just don&amp;#39;t touch it. Any interest that the deposit accrues is owed back to the tenant at the time that they move out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a separate checking account for my property. Rents are paid in, expenses paid out. That way, everything is in ONE location and it&amp;#39;s easy to figure out exactly what our profit/loss is. If you&amp;#39;re managing a property locally, get a debit card on that account for Lowes purchases. I also keep a savings account for each property for escrow and repairs. (one property is paid for, so I maintain a manual escrow account, the other is a straight emergency fund.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I structure my personal budget to pay my mortgages and rental expenses out of our base pay, and then use the rents to put money into retirement, savings, and my daughter&amp;#39;s college fund. That way, if (when) there&amp;#39;s a vacancy or a problem, I&amp;#39;m not coming out in the red during those months. We can at least cover our expenses on our base pay, even if there&amp;#39;s a month or two where we don&amp;#39;t quite get to retirement contributions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to emergency funds set aside directly for the property, make sure you can handle the one-off catastrophic emergency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catastrophic emergency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I lost $22,000 in rental real estate, between rehabbing my first home, fixing up the second, recovering from crappy tenants in the second, and worse. The city hit my sewer main, said it was my fault, and I was out $10,000 in a single month. 3 years ago, the heater in my first house went out in December, and I wrote a check for $7000. I currently have $16,000 invested in 3 different sewer main re-builds under two different houses. (never, EVER again buying anything with cast iron pipes.) These things happen, and we dealt with all of this on SSgt pay. Thankfully, most of those losses have been made up over the next 1-2 years&amp;#39; worth of rent, but you NEED to have the cash on hand to be able to cover these types of emergencies. Good credit is also helpful - I had to borrow $10,000 once to cover turnover and repairs, but ended up coming out on top in the end. Ultimately, your rental property is likely a significant chunk of your net worth, and while it may hurt to spend ten grand on a repair issue, that&amp;#39;s only 5% of the value of a $200,000 home. Not worth losing a whole asset over 5%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hassle factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landlording is not easy. Dealing with people, finances, local real estate markets, construction type repairs, etc. It&amp;#39;s a package deal. Some months I spend 30 minutes on it and make a decent amount of money. Some months it&amp;#39;s 30 hours a week and I lose money. Overall, I&amp;#39;ve done pretty well, but it&amp;#39;s the law of averages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchasing the next home with a rental&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOOOO... you&amp;#39;re on the brink, ready to rent out your current house and go buy another one. Here&amp;#39;s some things to think about: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financing considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;#39;ve PCSed and now want to buy a new house at your next duty station. That&amp;#39;s great, now you need to convince a loan officer to give you another mortgage for another property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you&amp;#39;re going to have to be able to afford a second mortgage with your current debt to income ratio. If your rental mortgage is all the debt you have, you&amp;#39;re probably in a good spot. Add in some vehicle or student loan debt, and now it doesnt look too good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use you rental income to compensate for the rental mortgage, but the bank will want to see 2 years tax returns with the income. Depending on when you converted it to a rental and what time a year you want to buy, 2 years tax returns can take closer to parts of 4 years to document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase conservatively&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank will do all they can to max out your DTI (debt to income ratio) to earn just as much interest off of you as they can. By choosing a smaller/cheaper home for your initial or second purchases, you can reign in the budget. Think of who you&amp;#39;re going to rent to when you PCS, and make sure you can afford to rent within BAH rates. Just because the bank says you can borrow a half million dollars on a mortgage doesn&amp;#39;t mean you should. And if you do, you will have zero room to finance the next property. Scroll back to the top where we talked about not over-buying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, heading into the weeds here... The more you&amp;#39;ve borrowed against a property, the higher the leverage ratio. This isn&amp;#39;t generally a problem if you&amp;#39;re living in your own home and plan to remain there for quite some time, but it does become a factor when the bank starts looking at your suitability for the next purchase. (&lt;a href=""https://www.thebalancesmb.com/top-don-ts-in-using-real-estate-leverage-2867098""&gt;https://www.thebalancesmb.com/top-don-ts-in-using-real-estate-leverage-2867098&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $100,000, your leverage ratio is .90, that&amp;#39;s very high. If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $400,000, your leverage ratio is now 0.225. That&amp;#39;s very conservative. With the same debt to income ratio, the real estate owner with the lower leverage ratio is going to be a much safer customer to the bank. You can better your leverage ratios by 1, paying down the house or 2, letting it appreciate. The first is within your control, the second is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest expense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single greatest expense in the first year of home ownership is the purchaser&amp;#39;s closing costs. Beyond the first year, the greatest expense on a financed property (barring an enormous catastrophic event) is the interest expense. The lower your interest expense, the higher your profit. You can lower your interest expense by 1, getting a better rate and 2, borrowing less. You can borrow less by either putting more down on the home, or by paying it down early. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying off a house early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this one is highly controversial in the landlord business. Some folks will say to borrow as much as possible against a rental property because the interest is completely tax deductible and you can leverage your cash to purchase multiple properties. It&amp;#39;s also possible (some years) to make a better rate of return in the stock market. While both of these schools of thought have validity, it&amp;#39;s overlooking the factor of RISK. I&amp;#39;ve personally paid off a rental property and it was one of the greatest feelings in the world. Sure, I&amp;#39;m not making quite as much on that money as I could, but the risk on a paid for property is much lower than with a financed property. It also doesn&amp;#39;t count towards my DTI any more, and isn&amp;#39;t much of a hassle factor in future property financing decisions. At a minimum, paying off the house will give you a return equal to the interest rate, minus the marginal taxes you would have paid if you had taken the deduction. However, if you achieved a greater rate of return elsewhere, you&amp;#39;d also owe taxes on that, at either capital gains rates or your personal marginal tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to churn and burn and just buy as many properties as possible, you&amp;#39;re likely going to finance all of them as much as you can. If your goal is to retire from the military with one or two investment properties, then work towards paying them off at a reasonable rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conventional VS creative financing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative financing is an option, but not one that most of us use. This would be something like, say, getting a loan from your uncle&amp;#39;s IRA to buy the house, and then you pay your uncle the interest. This is do-able if you&amp;#39;ve got rich friends/family who are willing to invest in your mortgage. However, loans like this require much more documentation when you&amp;#39;re looking at the next deal. Because banks are used to dealing with conforming loans (the fancy term for loans that fit all the rules), they may balk at a lender with a creatively financed asset in their portfolio. You&amp;#39;ll have a greater burden of paperwork and proof to demonstrate your continued creditworthiness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rental VS Owner occupied financing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can borrow money to purchase a rental, but the interest rates are usually a full or two full percentage points higher. On $100,000 borrowed, each full interest rate percentage is $1000 a year or $83 a month. Obviously, that amortizes, but that&amp;#39;s the starting expense at month 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refinancing a rental as a rental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the home is no longer owner occupied, it doesn&amp;#39;t fit the criteria for owner occupied financing. A re-finance at that point (to pull cash out, clear the VA entitlement, or re-structure of payments) will likely cost that $83 per month per $100,000 borrowed. If you live in a home that will be a rental and you need to update your financing, do it before you move out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larger down payment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always entice a bank with a larger down payment. The more money you put down on the next deal, the lower their risk is. Borrowing less also raises your DTI by a smaller amount, and that can help get you approved. Coming up with a larger down payment while turning your current property AND PCSing can be challenging, so plan ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another thing to think about with the down payment: Your down payment is your buffer between you and the real estate market fluctuating. If you have 5% equity in your house, and the market drops by 5%, you&amp;#39;re basically imobile. If you have 25% equity and the market drops 5%, you&amp;#39;re still down by that much of your net worth, but the remaining 20% equity gives you the ability to cover closing costs if you choose to sell, cover a dip in rents, etc. Better to lose money you have than money you don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say that again - Better to lose money you have, than money you don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys, rental real estate isn&amp;#39;t the whole thing. For the average homeowner, our home makes up the largest asset in our portfolio. If the house is paid for, it&amp;#39;s probably the most significant portion of our net worth. As soon as it&amp;#39;s rented, you now have one single asset worth a LOT of money, and all of your net worth is in the same asset class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to contribute to retirement through tax advantaged accounts (IRAs, TSP, 401Ks, etc). There&amp;#39;s been seasons in our life where we had to stop retirement contributions to get over a hump, but that should be the exception, not the norm. Do your own research if your rental property income changes the equation for you while deciding between Roth and Traditional contributions, but chances are, it shouldn&amp;#39;t make that big of a difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a problem, too. $100,000 worth of home may be worth $100,000, but it&amp;#39;s very difficult to convert a house that another family is living in, into cash. Borrowing against the property is an option, but only if your DTI can support it. Selling the property, at a minimum, will take 60 days. Maintain the amount of liquidity in your overall net worth (mine is in my emergency fund) to balance the amount that&amp;#39;s non-liquid. Your personal liquidity needs are dependent on your financial situation and your risk tolerance, but it is a factor to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I missed anything... ask, and I&amp;#39;ll find an answer. Hope this is helpful to someone here.&lt;/p&gt;

We are now in a position where I would like to aggressively save for early retirement.  My thought is to create a “bridge” until tapping into tax deferred accounts.  For example:

Save enough to stop working at 55 (or even 50 if possible).  At that point live on saved after tax assets until 70, at which point I would have required minimum withdrawals from 401ks worth $5mm+.  

So, my goal would be to max out 401ks (60k / year) for the next 21 years.  Retire at 55 and let the 401ks sit for another 15 years until tapping at age 70.

I would be saving XX amount to live from 55 (or 50) until 70. 

I don’t want to convert any 401k assets and let them grow untouched until I am 70.

Does this plan make sense?  Thoughts?  What else should I be thinking about here?  Happy to provide more details on personal situation.

This may seem a tad out there compared to conventional posts but I want to hear your thoughts! I've gotten really into solar builds and aquaponics for a while now and can't stop considering the benefits over time. While something like a solar array or 5,000 freshwater system is definitely a large start-up, it seems like (depending on where you live) one could invest marginal sums on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands into offsetting the cost of living. Can any of you project those kinds of savings on food and power (and even making that your ""fun activity) to justify funding such a specific and initially expensive hobby-approach to 'living large on less,' comparable to tiny home culture or traditional permaculture? I realize most of us here lean toward investing a good deal of our expendable income into retirement or market things that I'm not too privy on, but does it always make more sense to contribute financially towards something that can grow on the scale of something like an IRA or bonds through time? 

What if you could literally live on 20% or less of your income due to having a near-sustainable (and perhaps already paid-off) property, or is the growth overtime from more ""traditional"" investments toward retirement and properties worth it every time?

However, you will then show them that you were in fact making money and they will adjust your SS benefits accordingly.&amp;quot; This sounds a little to good to be true and I couldn&amp;#39;t find any mention of it anywhere on the interwebs. If anyone has any info I would appreciate it. Also, I know that I probably won&amp;#39;t see any SS benefits in 20 years, but I am curious nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

   (I am still on the board of company and have a minority interest. Have just been traveling with my wife until I figure out what to do next. )

My obsession and ability to make money.  Watching our sales grow every day, every year for 10 years was kind of like watching the stock market but way better.  

My daily number of human interactions.  My 100 employees at least felt like my friends.   We had low turn over and a relaxed environment and very little drama.  Work was fun.  I still see them from time to time but that is of course not the same as 40+ hours a week.  It was like family. 

Purpose. My new purpose to invest my money is not as interesting.  I feel like making money was the purpose of life.  Now that I have done it the video game is over... probably doesn’t help to all the sudden be middle aged as well!

Security.  Investing money I find to be way more stressful.  I feel like the market could collapse and it would hurt.  I don’t feel like a financial expert but I was an expert in online marketing and my industry and felt more secure earning an income every year.  This is not rational but how I feel.  Anxious. 

Being able to relate to people.  My friends outside of work have such a different life than me.  Some friendships still work but others are either different or just don’t work anymore due to jealousy or not enough things in common anymore.  

Hobbies.   I didn’t have many besides work related things like online marketing and social media marketing.   I also hurt my back weightlifting and couldn’t throw myself into working out like I had planned to.  Before meeting my wife there were many many boring lonely days.  It’s like being home sick from work while everyone else is at work, for months.  Having a wife who is an artist and sets her own schedule has pretty much fixed my extreme boredom and got it to just pretty bored sometimes level. :)

I propose 2% withdrawal + lifestyle inflation, and is much safer bet. It allows your principal to grow...which allows your withdrawals increase more than just the inflation rate.

It also feels better, because you are giving yourself ""annual raises"", for the hard work you did this year not going to work...lol!

Also, in the event of a major depression, you can just dial back your lifestyle inflation temporarily.

If you are using 2% withdrawal rate today and spending $50,000 per year....in 20-30 years, you will probably be spending $100,000 (in today's dollars) safely with no risk to financial ruin.

&lt;p&gt;So, that being said, I’m looking for a secure way to list all of our account info/passwords, etc. What do you guys use/recommend?&lt;/p&gt;

I've put a lot of thought into it, especially since I don't exactly love my job or line of work (finance .... i hate it), but think if I give it 5 years I can be really well set up for the rest of my family's life:

Current Situation:

* Income: $200,000 (low COL area)
* Savings (HY): $170,000
* Checking: $10,000
* Retirement Investments: $105,000 (basically all equity)
* Post-Tax Investments: $2,500 (literally one stock)
* Debt: (i) Student Loans: ($110,000 @ 4.2% - down from $250,000 four years ago); (ii) Auto: $10,000 and (iii) Credit Card: usually between $3,000 to $5,000 and pay down every month)

Plan is basically to spend the next two years paying down the student loans and adding to the savings account.  I figure 24 months should be enough to do it.  Additionally, starting in January, I plan on slowly getting into the market by taking half my monthly savings and dollar cost averaging into the market into diversified positions (70E/30D).  I plan on continuing to max out my 401K as well.  

After 2 years, we'll essentially hit a reset button and start aggressively investing (using a dollar cost averaging method, just upping the amount invested v. the amount going to savings.

After 5 years, I figure I'll be debt free, having well over $300,000 in savings, well over $100,000 in investments and retirement accounts should be nearing $200,000 as well (this is pretty conservative).

I know I keep way too much in terms of savings, but I really don't like my job and the thought of having enough money stashed away to say fuck it and quit for like 4 years really makes me happier and much less anxious about my debt and job situation.

----

First, I admit I basically don't *know* what I'm doing, personal finance-wise. What I mean by emphasizing the word ""know"" is that in *other* domains, I mostly *do* know what I'm doing. For me, those are things like science, music within my limited though serviceable sphere of ability, using English well, etc. 

But I have gotten on board with the principles of FIRE, and have learned at least the basics (thank you, guys!). My wife and I are mostly invested in a reasonable portfolio, she's maxed out a 457b and 403b for 2018, I'm working on maxing out a 457b and I'm hoping to now start a solo 401k. We are also considering to make the transition to ER or semi-ER in one year.

I also have accepted the adage ""time in market beats than timing the market"" (""TIMBTTM""). But that said, I want to sort of triple check about that here.

The last time I had a decent chunk to invest ($55k), it was right before a big dip in the market. For a person who waited 2 years to ask for a portion of my inheritance, to only invest it and then like the next day have the market take a dive, that was really off-putting. 

So I'm now considering putting maybe $15k, maybe more, all at once, into the new solo 401k. At the same time, I'll be switiching $7k of my HSA from cash to investment, and unwinding about $4k of a guaranteed annuity into investment. All told, this is about a $26k buy into the market within a few weeks. 

""TIMBTTM"" would say to just go ahead and dump it in (in our case, to index ETFs). But is there anything I should be ""paying attention to"" in the world/economic news first before we do this? But that's market timing, isn't it? 

I could spread these buys out a bit, of course, but then that also goes against ""TIMBTTM"".

We all know that the maximum 401(k) contribution in a single year is $18,500 pre-tax.  What I recently learned is that the aggregated maximum of $55k per year (including employer match and after-tax contributions) is actually per *unrelated* job. 

This means that if you change jobs mid-year or you happen to have a solo practice with a self-directed 401(k) + a separate W2 job, you could potentially max out both accounts, as long as you did not go above $18,500 in pre-tax money combined.

I know this is a corner case situation but this knowledge can be immensely helpful for job changers and the like.

White Coat Investor did an article on this and linked to the IRS page describing this.  Please note that I just argued with my Fidelity rep, who is insisting that it's not true, but I don't think that's particularly uncommon.

I'm still a bit nervous about this (this situation applies directly to my family this year) so I'm curious if anyone else has done this directly, and did you get pushback from your 401(k) providers or your accountant (if applicable).

This seemed to be a popular thread, so I thought I'd post an update for everyone.  Unfortunately, the Philadelphia job fell through, but I did get an offer to work in NYC.  The salary is for $130k with a 10-20% bonus and 8.5% employer match (vests 100% after 3 years).  Total comp is around $154k - $167k per year.  This represents a 64% - 78% raise.

​

Even though I'm moving to a higher COL location, my calculations show that I still come out ahead with this offer.  My office will be near a PATH stop, so I plan on living in NJ.  The commute will be under 30min, and I'll save on rent and NYC taxes.

Here's some advice I've come to realize.  I've been at the same company for 10 years.  It was my first job out of college.  It was right around the beginning of the recession, and I felt so lucky to get a job offer that I accepted before they told me what the salary was.  I started at $34k and got promoted every 2 years or so.  Current salary is $94k, which is an 11% CAG over 10 years.

​

I didn't think that was bad; in fact I think that's pretty good in terms of what a company is willing to do internally.  Still, look at how much money I left on the table by not seeking out a competitive offer sooner!  I think I fell into this trap because the job was low-stress and fairly easy.  It's important to constantly push yourself outside of your comfort zone, and develop new skills in different roles.

​

I recall a saying that the man with 10 years of the same experience is worse off than the man with 10 different 1 year experiences.

Edit: I also meant to add that I thought in the past about buying an apartment near Boston, but didn't since I'm not married.  I feel that the flexibility of renting and being able to move to NYC or the UK worked to my advantage in this instance.  I imagine it might be a harder decision for someone with a family.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original post is here:&lt;/p&gt;

The salary is for $130k with a 10-20% bonus and 8.5% employer match (vests 100% after 3 years).  Total comp is around $154k - $167k per year.  This represents a 64% - 78% raise.&lt;/p&gt;

The situation is I'd like to retire 'early' in 15 years (Currently 30), which (Not paying off early) will still give me a few years left on my mortgage.

So my question is how do you determine savings amounts when it comes to money into a house?

For instance, if my Net earnings are $2k a month, and I save $200, thats nice an easy - 10% savings.

Well, what if my earnings are $2k a month, but part of my mortgage is paying towards the principal of my house, $200 worth.  And I'm also putting $200 in a 401k?  Does the house principal payment move my savings to 20%?

Obviously the amount to the principal will change as the mortgage matures, but I'm not sure how to 'think' about it.  If my mortgage is $1,000 and $200 of it goes towards the principal, am I really 'saving' $200 a month? or is the expense just $1,000 until the house gets paid off?

Technically the $200 into the house isn't netting me a dime until the mortgage gets paid off, and then its just the reduced cost of housing every month beyond when the last payment is made (I'll still have to pay taxes/insurance/whatever, but it should cut my monthly 'rent' figure in half!).

So.. I guess, how do you go about incorporating that figure into your own financial plan or savings system?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a lurker on this sub, and most of the other stock/finances subs for quite awhile and I&amp;#39;m wondering how to best figure out my savings rate/effective savings.&lt;/p&gt;

Just looking for a sanity check and make sure we’re using our money correctly. I’m 55 and my wife is 59. I make $100k a year as an engineer and she does freelance work (1099 employee) and makes about $35k a year. We currently have $350k in a 401k, and I’m going to work another 7 years which should give us approx $600k in the 401k. I’m putting away 16% of my gross pay and my employer kicks in 3% for a total of 19% (or about $19k/yr). So in 6 years I’ll be 62 and her at 66. We’ll both take SS at that time, me early and her right at full SS. My company pension will be about $1300 at 62. My military reserve pension kicks in at 60 and is $2500/month. We’re going to use this to pay off the remaining $50k balance on our mortgage so we’re mortgage free by the time I’m 62. . Also get $400/mo from the VA for disability. We have 2 car payments that should be paid off in 2 years and 4 years respectively and pay off or credit card debt off every month. When I turn 60 we’ll also go to the Tricare medical system which costs are greatly reduced but I need to know more on this as the time comes. The only other thing is I have an autistic son that’s just on the autism spectrum, has learning disabilities and is taking classes at a community college but I need to make sure he’s all set. We max out our medical out-of-pocket every year at $10k but we’re trying to get him onto Medicaid because he’s eligible. So on paper in about 6 years we’re looking at this:
Monthly income
3% 401k = $1,500, both SS = $3,500, military pension = $2,500, VA = $400, work pension = $1,300 = $9,200
 
Besides some (hopefully) reasonable Tricare healthcare costs, property taxes ($3kyr now) and something for my son what else should I be looking at now and I the long-term? Thanks to all in advance.

​

I live in a low tax Asian country (think one of Hong Kong / Singapore). My plan is to immigrate to one of Australia / Canada in about 2 years' time and live there in the long term.

​

I am faced with a fork in the road and need to decide between continuing with my current job vs. taking on a new role:

​

A recent change in my current job's circumstances has made it so that I now have the option go remote. The work is very light and enjoyable, and offers plenty of opportunity to develop my technical skills (I'm a hybrid data scientist / software engineer).

​

Because of the light workload, I can potentially take on side gigs and top up my income. In fact, I already have a client lined up.

​

Even after accounting for the side gig, i'll only be averaging 15-20 hours of work a month. I can potentially find a second side gig to fill the rest of my time, but finding a suitable client will probably take a few months.

​

I landed a job offer with a local financial institution. The salary offered is equal to my current job+side gig, but I need to be in the office from 9-6.

​

The nature of the role is also very different: It will involve a lot of meetings and talking to people, but very little actual, hand-on technical work. I'm afraid of my technical skills becoming rusty if I were to work here for a long time.

​

I would like to think that I can still take on my side gig client if I were to take the finance role, though it might be rough in the first few months.

​

I'm 31, and I estimate I only have about 2 years left at this country after which I'll be immigrating to Oz / Canada. I think it will be a lot harder to save money after I immigrate because of high taxes.

​

Now for the numbers, all figures are in canadian dollars (CAD):

​

My LeanFI target is 1M, and I will feel full FI / FIRE at 1.6M.

​

Here are my estimated total savings in about 2 years from now under various scenarios:

1. 700k, If I were to continue with my current role + side gig. 15-20 hrs a week.
2. 700k, if I take the new finance job offer. 40 hrs a week.
3. 800-900k, if I can find a second client to freelance with (on top of my existing client+current job). I think I have about a 60-70% chance of finding one. 30-40 hrs a week.
4. 900k, if I take the new finance job offer + side gig with my existing client. 50-55 hrs a week.

​

Which option would you choose? At the end of 2 years from now, my circumstances will change drastically - I would have immigrated and I reckon I'll only be able to save about 100-140k a year from that point onwards.

​

Once my NW hits 1M, i'll feel comfortable taking a career break / travelling / relocating to a LCOL / working on ad-hoc projects / consulting, which are things I have been wanting to do for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I find working from home immensely enjoyable, and I absolutely dislike spending long hours in a typical corporate office environment. Sticking with my current gig + side jobs will make for a very enjoyable experience. The finance role is in a very traditional Asian firm, where facetime is very important.

 If you live near a luxury car dealership(Lexus, Audi, BMW, Benz, etc) they are usually always looking to hire delivery drivers for the sales and service departments. These drivers deliver cars to and from out of town, and even out of state customers. For instance, Bob lives 3hrs away from the dealership, but needs to bring his car in for service. Bob would rather pay for the dealer to bring him a loaner car, pick up his car, then return to swap cars again.

The industry standard in most dealerships I've worked in seems to be older, retired men who just want to make a little extra money. But we search constantly for drivers because many of these people have very limited availability, so we try to keep a pool of drivers to choose from. Work is basically served up like a courier service, you tell us when you're available, we call when there's a delivery, you tell us if you can make it. You get paid for mileage on deliveries. For long distance out of town deliveries, some of our drivers make $160 in a day for a 6hr trip, but most make 100-150 per day, doing 2 shorter distance deliveries. You can listen to audio books, etc while driving.

I just thought I'd share this, since it's not a well known job, but it is a position that's usually hiring at most dealers, and it has great earning potential for something where you could work as many or as few days as you'd like with tons of flexibility.

 A proper edit now that I'm at a computer:

 I'm not offering anyone a job, if you want to know if a dealer near you does this and is hiring, call them. 


 Most of these positions are not eligible for benefits, as others have pointed out. I was not aware there were part time positions that offered health insurance, so I didn't consider this a factor, but I'm adding this to ensure nobody goes into this EXPECTING benefits. Employment status and type is dependent on dealer, results will vary.

 You need a valid driver's license and clean driving record for at least the last 3 years to be considered, this is pretty standard but can vary. 

 You can be employed as either an employee or a 1099 contractor. Most of my experience indicates the former, though as others pointed out that may be the minority, and likely is since i live in a small city and have worked for small dealers. There is a high likelihood your dealer will offer this as a 1099 position. 

 This was never meant to be ""here is a great way to get benefits in part time employment"" and I didn't mean to lead anyone to believe that was the case. This was meant to alert people to an easy, laid back, super flexible job that pays well and has you dealing with nice people most of the time.

\-Saving the extra 18k efficiently.  
At 18k/year, I'm worried it will take many years to get a decent down payment, let's say 5. That's 90k sitting in a HY savings, not really gaining much for 5 years, from age 27-32. a lot to be missed out on.

\-Money lost to rent, time lost to paying off a house -   
My rent is pretty affordable now because it is significantly less than the other apartments in the area. So if I move at all, that will go up. Should I reduce my 457 contributions for a little while some to cut the time saving for my down payment?   
Looking for any criticisms, tips, what you would do, or did, etc. I live pretty frugally for the most part on a day-to-day but I do travel a decent amount, which I think will slow in the coming years but at the moment, it is worth it to me even if I know it might set my FI back.

&amp;#x200B;

Since my last post I still have not bought a house, but am still considering it possibly 1-2 years from now so I've been starting to hold a little more cash (in a high yield savings account) with that in mind. My local real estate market is bananas and I just extended my lease so I will reevaluate next year.

&amp;#x200B;

The vast. vast majority of my investments are in regular old cheap and balanced index funds, and breakdown by account type:

\- 401k: $183,000

\- Roth IRA: $74,000

\- HSA: $29,000

\- Taxable: $158,000

&amp;#x200B;

I recently turned 31 and earn about 150k in total comp (salary, bonuses, matches, etc) and live in one of the more expensive cities in the US. I've been fortunate to progress relatively rapidly in my career, and I have continually saved 40-50% or more along the way. I consider myself pretty careful with my money, but wouldn't say that I am extraordinarily frugal since I have plenty of vices and expensive hobbies but I keep them in check. I pay myself first according to my plan and spend the rest on things I've decided are worth it to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a concrete FI number since it depends on so many life circumstances, but my current motivational dream is to get to in the $1.5-2m range and cut back to a more part-time/flexible consulting schedule. I believe this would be relatively easy to arrange on my career path and with the network of people and companies I've worked with. I think this is achievable by age 40 on my current path, potentially sooner if things go especially well.

I am a 26 year old, married with a 3 year old and another child expected next month. I am an active duty Air Force member, hitting my 6 year mark next month... I made E6 this year and will be putting on my new rank next year in August.

I've always thought I was doing pretty well, compared to my peers. Most of them have 500+ car payments, no retirement or savings, no plans for investing/saving. I have made rank quickly and been fairly responsible with money.... I thought this until I found a few financial blogs and this Reddit. Reality check, big time.

I will stay until 20 to earn my pension. The goal is either E7 or commission and retire an O4. I have just over a year of school left and am taking classes full time at night. Retired rank will impact my ability to FIRE significantly.

Here's my current situation.

6500 in savings, 4000 in physical silver, 10k in TSP.

I own 3 vehicles. A project car that's paid for and 98% done, my daily and wife's/family car. I owe about 7k on each. About 8k in equity in one and 13k in the other. This is our only debt.

Single income, small raise next month and another small raise this time next year. We currently put 400 a month into our Roth TSP. I stopped our TSP this month and opened an account with Charles Schwab.

My plan is to start a Roth IRA so I can withdraw contributions if I were to retire early or need the money post military. I will bump up contributions to max the IRA each year and put the excess money towards paying off our vehicles.

I will be getting about 7k in bonus money and plan to pay off my car. This will free up another $130 per month. My tax return will be about 6-7k as well... Should I pay off the other car as well? That would free up ~160 a month.

Both interest rates are below 3%

I have debated on using all money in excess of my max contribution and throwing it into savings in expectation of a market reset so I can buy into an index fund ""on sale"" but I know how this group feels about timing the market.

Next month I will have 600-700 a month I can easily save, a year from now 800-900 is doable. We are analyzing our budget now to find room to cut back (we know there is definitely room for improvement)

I searched the subreddit and checked the FAQ for this without seeing anything about this topic, so I&amp;#39;m sorry if this has been asked before.&lt;/p&gt;

I know most people here have a lot more than I do in investments but relative to my ""cash,"" it's significantly more. But that's good.

I know this concept is obvious to most here but I just wanted to lay some words out for my own benefit. It's taboo to talk about savings, investments with pretty much anyone but your spouse these days so this forum is an anonymous and non-judgmental place to talk about it and it's nice to have that outlet.

I've made some changes to my assets and allocations and this is where I'm currently sitting, at age 30. I'm now sitting at about $17,000 in cash/savings and $280,000 in investment funds between my IRA, taxable account and 401k. The rest of my networth is in real estate equity (primary house, which I have a little over $200k equity in).

The interesting thing about this is that while we now have ""a lot"" of money stashed away, we're relatively cash-poor. By forcing yourself to live this way it's really easy to keep your unnecessary impulse buys and expensive habits down. I have a lot of expensive interests -- cars, watches, vacations. But with only $17k stashed in savings -- most of which is set aside for medical deductibles and related expenses in case we get pregnant soon -- I'm not necessarily in a position to go buy a new car, a new Rolex, or take an extra $10,000 vacation. 

My goal is $1 million in investments by age 40. I don't know how possible that's going to be, but even if I miss the mark a little bit and end up at $700,000 or so I'm going to be pretty happy with myself. Goal is retirement by age 55. No later than that. FIRE number is anywhere between $2 million and $2.5 million -- depending on market stability, inflation, expenses (how many kids we have), etc. at that point.

The good news? I'm in a good position and I make a lot of money for my LCOL area (about $75k/year), and my wife has a decent job ($50-55k) in a very consistent and reliable line of work (healthcare industry). She will have her student loans paid off this month, getting her to a net positive net worth.

The bad news? My wife has almost no investments (about $4,000 in an IRA) because she just graduated 3 years ago. She will be signing up for her newest job's 401k next month. But she will be able to dedicate the $1,000/month she was putting toward her student loans into investments, with my help on allocations.

The good and bad news? We're planning to have a kid soon, which is great. But is a huge financial burden. But I know we can make it work. 

Anyway that's all. Sorry that this wasn't a helpful post for the rest of you guys. Just wanted to get some things off my chest, I guess.

1. Is this something most people here do on their own or do you work with a tax adviser or an investment adviser?  How about the company your 401k is with?  They can convert it to traditional IRA I know.

2. I previously thought the conversion had to fully occur in five years, but now I think it can be spread out over more years than that.  Is that right?  It sounds like you decide how much to convert each year based on what you'll need for living expenses after five years and taking into account things like healthcare income limits and tax brackets/filing status.

I'm trying to get a better understanding of this to get it started this year so I really appreciate any advice you can offer, thanks!

And, as the kids have grown older...they don&amp;#39;t really care about going to the shore anymore; they&amp;#39;d rather be home where their friends are and/or use the pool/house electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, we average about $3800/year on what I&amp;#39;d call significant vacations.  These included Niagara Falls, Jamaica, Disney (Fla), Poconos skiing, Europe (UK/Fr/Bel/Ger/Lux), San Francisco, New Orleans, Puerto Rico.  We just got back from a Salem/Boston MA long weekend and will be headed to Ireland for a week in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my wife wants to use a Groupon offer to go to Greece over the Christmas holidays (Dec 26-30).  Sure, a good deal and all, but I think it&amp;#39;s excessive at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question is, what does the FI community consider to be reasonable for vacationing while saving responsibly for retirement?  How often do you vacation and how much money do you spend per year on vacation time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I should note that we are big on travel and experiencing new things both for ourselves and our kids.  It&amp;#39;s one of the things we are willing to commit money to prior to FI because we feel it is an investment in enriching our lives and that of our children.  We are still saving enough (though not a SR like most of the folks I see here) that we&amp;#39;ll still be able to enjoy continuing that lifestyle well in to retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

So, I've recently separated from the Army after 9 years of service.  Definitely not something I regret but due to health issues (and the fact that I moved 7 times in 9 years) I decided to move on to civilian life.  It was when I was going through out-processing, that we had a finance brief for Soldiers that were leaving the army and the instructor asked if any of us had money in the TSP (Thrift Savings program, basically the equivalent of a 401k).  I was the only person in the room to raise my hand out of about 10 or so people present, and some of the other Soldiers in the room looked around the age of retirement.  I was shocked no one had any money in what is one of the lowest cost retirement funds (not to mention best guaranteed not to fail) available.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, contributing to retirement funds is not something new on this subreddit.  But during my time in the army I've had the opportunity to take advantage of a ton of programs that have saved me a ton of time and money, and it boggles my mind that so few people take advantage of those opportunities.  For example both life and health insurance in the army is dirt cheap.  I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth taken out before I left and it didn't cost me a dime in co-pay or deductibles.  I've gotten free glasses (even prescription sun glasses), immunizations, exams etc.  Yet I've had to chase down and force Soldiers to attend scheduled medical appointments (which they can go to during work hours and don't have to pay any extra for).

&amp;#x200B;

I had the opportunity to attend training and classes that counted towards college credit and that I attended as part of my job, not something I had to do in my free time.  I earned my masters degree with the G.I. Bill and didn't pay a dime for that either (I even got a little money to pay for my text books) and I've got enough left of it to earn another degree if I want (or a bunch of certifications).  When I left the army I applied for disability but also learned that since I'm over 50% disabled I quality for priority 1 VA Health Care, which is essentially free health care (with a few constraints but nothing big) and basically makes health insurance unnecessary (that's saving me several thousand dollars a year alone).  I initially didn't think I qualified for VA health care unless I fully retired after 20+ years in.  I only found out about this on my way out and I've talked to some other veterans who (like me before I left) also had no idea that they qualified either so I bring it up whenever I meet a fellow vet now.

&amp;#x200B;

After leaving the military, I attended my first job fair.  On the event flyer there was a seminar available just before the event to help people learn how to get the most out of a job fair.  I had to get up early to make it but I attended it and hit it off with the presenter as he was also prior military and after the seminar he told me of a couple of contractors at the event that had just gotten new government contracts and were looking for veterans and had jobs so new they had not even been posted on job boards yet.  I stopped by both those tables and turned in my resume and got called by them the following week and am interviewing with one of them next week.

TLDR: Life will present you with opportunities, some of which may be obvious and some of which may not.  If an opportunity comes along, take advantage of it (so long as it's not something that requires a major gamble on your part like bitcoin).  If no opportunities are obviously available then search around for them, ask people you know, do some research.  Even if they don't always directly put cash in your bank account, they may help give you a boost in some other aspect of your life.  And you never know when you might encounter something life changing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat of a ramble of my experience regarding taking advantage of opportunities that life presents you as the ones I&amp;#39;ve had have significantly sped up my progress on my way to FIRE and don&amp;#39;t involve crazy stuff like winning the lottery or creating Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

​

A lot of my friends are impressed with what I have pulled off in just 3 years and other people have asked me how I've done it, so just thought I'd share because it really isn't that hard.

​

In my 20s I did what I loved, sound engineering, and was surviving, but not saving and had no debt. The crash of 2008 happened and no one is booking sessions anymore, so I needed to find something else. I start at an IT Help Desk at a large corp, start reading books on how to get promoted, and get promoted 4 times in 6 years going from $40k-&gt;$75k

​

I was saving at a decent rate and in 2016 I bought a 4 family flat for $100k. Everything worked and it even came with tenants that were already paying the rent. Revenue was $2k and mortgage was $828 for a 15 year loan, so I was profiting an extra $1200 a month. All that money went back into savings.

​

In early 2017 I bought another 4 fam, with almost identical rev, costs, &amp; profit and another in late 2017. I close on my next purchase tomorrow which is essentially the same as the others. My plan is to buy ten 4 families and then retire in about 4 years while making over $100k/year. Then in 15 years when the mortgages are paid I'll get an extra boost in profits.

​

**Does anyone see any flaws in my plan?** It's been working really well so far. I have only had to not renew 1 lease because the lady was nuts and I had another renter in that unit on the 1st after she vacated. The purchase prices are so low because it's in a bad area in a rust belt city, however at the same time it is a really popular place to live for some reason. Also I know how to repair things, so I never have to pay anyone to fix anything. Also I have $0 in stocks or 401k. I cleared all that out to start down this path and I have $20k emergency savings. I also own a $300k house that I've owned for 10 years and should be paid off early in another 10.

​

The only downside to my plan is that that solo health insurance is astronomical and I'm afraid it's only going to get worse.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello All,&lt;/p&gt;

First, some particulars: early 30s, $150k current annual salary - expected 10% growth for the next couple of years, but probably not much more than that on the current track. I've only been working for a couple of years after PhD completion so capital is low ($31k cash, $56k investments (Vanguard $15k, $35k 401k, $6k stocks), $65k equity in recently purchased house, $600k outstanding at 4.25%, very HCOL market with housing prices going up like mad - my house has appreciated 12% since I bought it 6 months ago). 

I make 26 mortgage payments a year (effectively 13 monthly payments), but I'm not sure if it's better to pay that down ASAP or put extra cash in the Vanguard index fund.

I max out my 401k, contribute to but do not max out my HSA ($2.5k current), and do NOT have any sort of IRA yet.

I currently save around $4k a month after expenses and taxes, in part because my partner ($105k salary) pays half of my mortgage and living expenses, but we do not now nor do we intend to share joint accounts for anything else. We do pitch in when buying furniture or other sizable shared equipment. We also spend a decent amount on dog care ($500/mo) since we both have full-time jobs and hire dog walking services.

I feel like I have too much cash sitting there not doing anything for me, but I'm also cautious about not having at least $10-15k liquid cash as an emergency fund. I also feel like I'm not capitalizing on my IRA, which I've not contributed to yet in part because of the tiny $5.5k cap and also because I wasn't yet prepared to deal with backdoor Roths, but I am prepared to do that now/soon if you all think that's a high priority.

I could probably save more if I cut out some discretionary spending, as I definitely overspend on food/eating out, though I generally do not have other very expensive habits outside of dog spend which isn't likely to change. My strategy thus far has been to out-earn my spending which is roughly static.

I have no debt outside the mortgage, and have paid off all student loans.

I'm humbly looking for guidance on where I'm going off the rails so I can course correct and make use of the money I have coming in. Downsizing the house is possible but not preferred since the market is only getting more expensive here and it would impact my commute far too much.

I'm interested in hearing this community's thoughts on my current plans to be an adjunct professor during coast fire.

My goal is for my wife and I to hit FI with \~$2M of assets around 35. After 35, my wife intends to keep working (\~50k of income) and I'm interested in switching from my current finance role to being an adjunct professor with 1-2 classes a semester + working in the national guard (I was in the National Guard previously and really enjoyed it).  I expect our expenses to be around 80-90k a year and our income to be \~15k from adjuncting, \~15k from the National Guard, \~50k from my wife's work. Beyond that, I expected to have a small .5-1% withdrawal during the coast fire period to cover any expenses outside of our income.  My goal would be to fully retire by around 50.

I'd love to hear experiences from current/former adjuncts or anyone doing this during retirement. Maybe a few specific questions that I'd love to get an answer to:

1. Is adjuncting fulfilling? Do you feel like you're making a positive impact on your students?
2. How is the job market for finance adjuncts? Is pay higher than for other adjuncting fields (and does anyone have an estimate for rate for a class)?
3. How are credentials valued within the field? I work for a top asset management firm/hedge fund and have an M7 MBA, but I'll only have \~8 years of experience by the time i try to start adjuncting.  Is the lack of PhD/experience going to be problematic, especially for teaching positions at the graduate level? Similarly, how competitive are teaching positions at solid but not top MBA programs (say, ranked 30-50).
4. How difficult is it to teach niche courses (aka value investing courses)? Will experience within a field give you say in the courses you teach or will I teach exclusively introductory courses?
5. How many hours do you put into a normal 3 credit course between creating lessons, teaching, office hours, etc?

I decided to run some retirement forecasting today and as part of that I looked at a few factors. But in keeping in nature with the subreddit, let me lay out the numbers first:

* Married couple, 1 kid, 1 on the way – 35 years old
* Combined salary income $230K before tax
* $13K brokerage (mostly VTI)
* $130K stock options ($56K vested, $2300/mo vesting)
* Home #1: Investment/Future Retirement property - $190K value, paid in full (not renting)
* Home #2: Primary residence - $290K value, $215K outstanding 30-year fixed @ 4%
* No other debts (cars paid in full, monthly credit cards paid in full each month)
* $25K checking (emergency fund and buying more index funds on market dips)

# Retirement:

* $300K combined 401K &amp; Roth
* (this is where it gets interesting)
* Pension – gov’t pension, qualifies for $1,950/mo able to begin receiving at 50 years old
* Social Security – combined statements say total qualified at 59.5 is roughly $3,500/mo

# Expenses:

* Current monthly spend of $5,848/mo
* $2,185/mo of this is mortgage and childcare

So here is my what I’m seeing (I’m sure I’m missing something):

* Liquid or semi-liquid assets = $25K+$130K+$13K = $168K
* Current Outstanding Debt = $215K
* $215K-$168K = $47K more savings and I could be \*debt free\* and wipe out my mortgage payment resulting in effectively a $1,000/mo annuity (net savings)
* In 5 years, when the kids go to kindergarten, that will eliminate $1,185/mo
* This will bring my monthly spend to about $3,663 or $43,956/yr.
* $43,956 x 25 = $1.1M
* \*However\* that pension can be drawn at 50 years old, so at 50 I’d need $3,663 - $1,950 = $1,713/mo or $20,556/yr. Multiply that by the rule of 25 = $513,900.
* Based on my current investment rate, we should \*easily\* be able to grow our Roth and 401K by $213,900 in 15 years.
* Therefore, if I assume I can save enough money to last 9 years (from age 50 to 59.5) on the pension alone and then social security kicks in – I think I’m home free right?

Does this mean I’m on track to retire in 15 years or less? I think the two biggest things I’m not factoring in here are 1.) healthcare, and 2.) inflation. However, I’m also not factoring in wage growth or more investments in those 15 years and my savings rate in 5 years \*could\* be something like $100K/yr. if I was really aggressive.

My hope in sharing this is that it'll be helpful to others and maybe even improve on the technique (and share if you do!).

​

My husband and I are both avid stalkers of this forum and have been saving for years. Neither of us got any formal teaching in how to save - we just observed our parents making frugal choices and not overly-stressing over money and that more-or-less got the message through to us by mid-adulthood. Now we have 4 kids and we've been trying to figure out how to make the desire to save ingrained in a more proactive manner. I've read *""The Opposite of Spoiled""* and while we love the idea, our kids are ultimately still too young (our kids are 5 and 2.5).

​

Here's where we stumbled on a surprisingly successful idea. We had been using ""tokens"" - ie poker chips - to reward good behavior. Start the day with 3 tokens and earn a token every time you do a big helper job (like taking out the recycle) or lose a token if you're unkind or disobedient. Tokens are not given out for their chores - each kiddo has chores they have to do every day and tokens are not awarded for those jobs done; we didn't want to get into a ""pay me for doing any work around the house"" scenario. We frequently remind them that the chore list grows as they get older and they've seen it happen, but because we by-large do chores as a family, there has been zero push back when we transfer jobs from token-earning to regular-chores. At the end of the day, the tokens are cashed in for sugar of various forms: right now a jelly bean is 1 token, a buttermint is 2 tokens, and an oreo is 5 tokens. The kids typically end up with a range between 3-7 tokens; on really great days they'll break 10.

​

This worked pretty well for behavior adjustment, and then one of our 5 year olds had a really good day (lots of sugar at the end) and decided she didn't want to eat it all. She got a bowl with her name on it, and she saved the extra. We told her she could eat it the following day whenever she wanted - that it was hers. Our other 5 year old wanted a bowl with her name on it too, but (we were becoming wise) we told her she could only have a bowl if she saved. Now we had two kids saving candy day over day.

​

They started telling the two 2.5 year olds how *awesome* it is to be able to eat candy the next day whenever you want. The littles tried it once, but ultimately instant gratification would win out. Then I decided to introduce interest. Our new rule is: if you save at least one jelly bean or half an oreo through breakfast the next day, you get *another* jelly bean in your bowl. This was life-changing for the littles - they now regularly save over and above what they have to and sometimes ask for their bowls just to count their candies. EDIT: I've had a few ask so clarification: interest is only 1 jelly bean total, no compounding :)

​

At one point my 5 year olds took their candy bowls downstairs in the evening to play video games with me and ate all of their candy at once. I had warned them that it's easy to eat more than you expect while watching TV but ultimately we let them learn simple lessons the active way. And it was so exciting the next day to hear them comment to each other things like, ""We shouldn't have taken our candy downstairs."" ""Yea, my bowl is empty and I'm sad.""

​

""*The Opposite of Spoiled""* is a great book and we'll definitely be applying it as the kids get older but my initial mistake was using cash - a currency kids just don't care about. By introducing small amounts of sugar as a currency instead, I feel like we're early on teaching them about the joys of surplus and the avoidance of instant gratification. What's more, they now have the terminology already in place - we talk about saving candy for later, earning interest on it. The hope is that they will have an active understanding of the power of saving from toddlerhood on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Life Situation:** single, 30, california, no dependents

&amp;#x200B;

**FIRE Progress:**   I'm currently a mid/high end escort, transitioning to be more exclusively high end. I have a degenerative neurological disorder, so I'm trying to make as much money as I possibly can so that when I can't work anymore, I'll still be able to support myself and my mother. I've mentally put a 5 year cap on this unless I can do truly high end work ($1500-2000/hr) and only have to book 4-5 appointments per month to meet my goals. 

I'm currently helping my mother out with $200/mo, but ideally I'd be able to provide her with closer to $1k to make sure her rent and bills are covered, so she can spend her SSI on things like food, getting her car fixed, getting health care, etc. and not have to kill herself working just to scrape by. 

 

**GOALS/PROGRESS:**

* \- Make enough money to help Mom retire
* \- Make enough money to cover basic expenses &amp; only have to do minimal work to cover luxury spending
* \- Get a house
* \- Get braces/septoplasty \~$10k?
* ~~- Pay off debts~~ just a couple months shy of accomplishing this, so that's exciting as heck!

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly Income:**

* Escorting/Sugaring - $4000-6000
* Misc freelance design work - $0-500

​

**Monthly Expenses:**

* Rent/Utilities - $2050
* Medical/Dental - $400
* Phone/Rides/Transit - $420
* Food - $300
* Mom - $200
* Assistant/Accountant - $500 (if I make over 5k escorting, 10% of my escorting income)

  I also would like to set aside money each month to start fixing/upgrading various stuff that needs it. (my PC is failing and the monitor goes in and out as it pleases, my laptop only works when plugged in, would love to get laser hair removel, etc) 

​

**Current** **Monthly Remainder: $130 - $2330**

​My income should be increasing as I raise my rates, so within the next 8 months my goal is to make closer to $6000-9000 a month, and within a year to be making &gt;$10k.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yearly Savings Amounts:** zilch so far

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Ordinary Income:**  I have some plans in the works that have made money for me in the past that I'll be starting up again to provide some passive income for myself (and are actual hobbies and passions that I'll pursue in 'retirement'), but the main brunt of financing is going to be coming from sex work. At most I was making \~$1000/mo, it will most likely be more like $200/mo for awhile when I start again. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Expected ER expenses:** Probably a fair amount health care wise. I'd like to have kids at some point as well, but expect to have a partner to help fund that. I'd like to be able to travel as I've never really had a chance to?

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets:** this booty  **👉😎👉** But really, I don't own a house or car. Computer is old. Lots of clothes?

&amp;#x200B;

**Specific Question(s):**  

What is the most efficient way for me to take this money and invest it and generate more? Caveats being I try to operate mostly in cash to cut down on laundering and suspicious income, and that currently I have medium-low credit. I'm paying off the last of the outstanding debts I have and am working on improving my credit score, if that impacts anything.

​

I've tried looking into stocks and such but kinda got overwhelmed when I looked into Binary Option Trading and it seemed like &gt;50% of the websites are scams, and I don't know enough about this arena to know when I'm getting fucked (unlike my day job! **👉😎👉** ) so I just kinda gave up. More advice in that arena and savings info would be very appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine pointed me in the direction of this sub, so hopefully this is the right place to ask these questions!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; single, 30, california, no dependents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE Progress:&lt;/strong&gt;   I&amp;#39;m currently a mid/high end escort, transitioning to be more exclusively high end. I have a degenerative neurological disorder, so I&amp;#39;m trying to make as much money as I possibly can so that when I can&amp;#39;t work anymore, I&amp;#39;ll still be able to support myself and my mother. I&amp;#39;ve mentally put a 5 year cap on this unless I can do truly high end work ($1500-2000/hr) and only have to book 4-5 appointments per month to meet my goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently helping my mother out with $200/mo, but ideally I&amp;#39;d be able to provide her with closer to $1k to make sure her rent and bills are covered, so she can spend her SSI on things like food, getting her car fixed, getting health care, etc. and not have to kill herself working just to scrape by. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOALS/PROGRESS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Make enough money to help Mom retire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Make enough money to cover basic expenses &amp;amp; only have to do minimal work to cover luxury spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Get a house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Get braces/septoplasty ~$10k?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;- Pay off debts&lt;/del&gt; just a couple months shy of accomplishing this, so that&amp;#39;s exciting as heck!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Income:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escorting/Sugaring - $4000-6000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misc freelance design work - $0-500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Expenses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent/Utilities - $2050&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical/Dental - $400&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone/Rides/Transit - $420&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food - $300&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mom - $200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant/Accountant - $500 (if I make over 5k escorting, 10% of my escorting income)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also would like to set aside money each month to start fixing/upgrading various stuff that needs it. (my PC is failing and the monitor goes in and out as it pleases, my laptop only works when plugged in, would love to get laser hair removel, etc) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Monthly Remainder: $130 - $2330&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​My income should be increasing as I raise my rates, so within the next 8 months my goal is to make closer to $6000-9000 a month, and within a year to be making &amp;gt;$10k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yearly Savings Amounts:&lt;/strong&gt; zilch so far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Ordinary Income:&lt;/strong&gt;  I have some plans in the works that have made money for me in the past that I&amp;#39;ll be starting up again to provide some passive income for myself (and are actual hobbies and passions that I&amp;#39;ll pursue in &amp;#39;retirement&amp;#39;), but the main brunt of financing is going to be coming from sex work. At most I was making ~$1000/mo, it will most likely be more like $200/mo for awhile when I start again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected ER expenses:&lt;/strong&gt; Probably a fair amount health care wise. I&amp;#39;d like to have kids at some point as well, but expect to have a partner to help fund that. I&amp;#39;d like to be able to travel as I&amp;#39;ve never really had a chance to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; this booty  &lt;strong&gt;👉😎👉&lt;/strong&gt; But really, I don&amp;#39;t own a house or car. Computer is old. Lots of clothes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Question(s):&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the most efficient way for me to take this money and invest it and generate more? Caveats being I try to operate mostly in cash to cut down on laundering and suspicious income, and that currently I have medium-low credit. I&amp;#39;m paying off the last of the outstanding debts I have and am working on improving my credit score, if that impacts anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried looking into stocks and such but kinda got overwhelmed when I looked into Binary Option Trading and it seemed like &amp;gt;50% of the websites are scams, and I don&amp;#39;t know enough about this arena to know when I&amp;#39;m getting fucked (unlike my day job! &lt;strong&gt;👉😎👉&lt;/strong&gt; ) so I just kinda gave up. More advice in that arena and savings info would be very appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

I am a regular on this board.

At the beginning of this year, I was four years from my initial FI number. Though not in a career I was thrilled about, I was on cruise control. Then two things happened:

1) I lost my job and have had no success landing a new one, of that caliber. I live in a MCOL area and well paying/interesting opportunities (to me) are elusive (not to say that I could land any of them).
2) An unexpected inheritance pushed me past my FI number. As long as I keep my COL in check, I likely never have to work again.

My plan was to FI in four or five years, once both teenage kids are off at university, and go sailing. 

I need something to do between now and shoving the boat off from the dock. I would like to make enough money to cover monthly expenses and grow my nest-egg, but I don’t know what the hell to do.

I am in my mid-forties and have had a scattered career (mostly sales and project management). I have had a couple of great jobs, and several meh jobs. I can’t say that I have ever had great satisfaction or fulfillment from my  work.

Have any of you been in a similar situation? Any tips on self-discovery and finding gratifying work? What if you had four or five years to kill before RE and wanted to do something new? I don’t want to stop working, but I have the financial power to say FU to the grind. Thanks in advance, for any thoughts and ideas, no matter how random.

EDIT/UPDATE
So much wonderful input. Thank you all. You've helped clear the fog. 

So, after leaving it to you mad women and mad men to help me figure things out, here's what I will do during the next four years. And, if the work is rewarding, perhaps beyond:
1) Leverage my project management experience and cert into a new gig or consulting gigs. I will work Mon-Thur. I have no fear of hard work, but a bit more freedom (three day weekends) is required. 
2) Get into great physical shape. Fortunately, I have not let myself get too far out of shape. This is already in motion.
3) Prep for the Single-handed Transpac, and do it, four years from now. This one intimidates me. The original plan was to enter six, even eight years from now. The prep will take some serious work.

What do you think?

I’m a 27-year-old male who lives in Zambia, a southern African country you probably haven’t heard of and that’s a good thing. I’m a Software Engineer by profession and have been working since the age of 21. During this time, I have been able to complete my master’s degree (2016) and buy my own plot of land for 118,000ZMW/$11,800 (2017). I have zero debt and I’m also the primary breadwinner supporting both my parents (retired with no passive income) and a sibling. 

&amp;#x200B;

My countries economy is primarily cash based. Most items, including cars and property, must be bought up-front with very little wiggle room. Credit cards are extremely rare and debit cards are the norm. Several banks and institutions do offer mortgages however they are ridiculously expensive, and most individuals don’t bother with them and construct their houses over a period of 2 to 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

My take home salary is around $2,900 per month, it terms of PPP that’s equivalent to netting $7,700 in the USA ([http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/](http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/)). Locally, it’s a significant amount of money.

&amp;#x200B;

My current net worth is 368,000ZMW/$36,800 or in $98,000 PPP.

&amp;#x200B;

**Awakening (2017)**

Being financially independent or retiring early was a completely foreign concept for me till early 2017. At this point in time I got a job at a bank and it completely changed the way I looked at finances and income in general. For starters, everyone was much older than me (average age of 55 in the IT department, I kid you not) and by extension already planning for (if not already transitioning into) retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

In this organization, every other member of staff was either the owner of multiple rental properties or a farmer. Furthermore, working with the Financial Markets department introduced me to government bonds and securities, which were a safe and lucrative form of investment. Being exposed to all of this made me feel like I was sleeping at the wheel and just coasting through life (despite being relatively “successful” for my age).

&amp;#x200B;

I have since formulated an “investment roadmap” and created a detailed budget with all projected monthly incomes and expenses laid-out  till December 2026 (Age 35).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1 - No Rent and less family expenses (2018 - 2019)**

Phase 1 is to get the heck out of my parents’ house and into my own home. Yes, I still live with them which is a drag, but it also allows me to save 70% of my net income &gt;\_&gt;. As mentioned earlier, I am the sole bread winner and cover 80% of all family expenses, my mums Cake business tops out the rest. Regardless, I am beginning construction of my house this October and expect to wrap up by Mid-2019. Once complete I will move out and won’t be burdened by rent. The total cost of construction will likely top out at 400,000ZMW ($40,000).

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond that, I will help my parents complete a rental property which is currently at roof level. I have already contributed to this project in the past and when all is said and done I would have contributed about $8000 in total. Apart from my parents owning 1 rental property by the end of 2019 they will also begin constructing two more structures once they receive their full retirement benefits in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my parents will be able to support themselves and I should be able to continue saving at least 65% of my take home salary in 2019 and beyond (Age 28).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2 – Government Treasury bills (2018 - 2026)**

All Government securities have very competitive rates. Basically, the Bank of Zambia has auctions every fortnight for both competitive and non-competitive securities. See, [http://www.boz.zm/2018-treasury-bill-results.htm](http://www.boz.zm/2018-treasury-bill-results.htm) for details.

&amp;#x200B;

In August 2018, Treasury Bills of 91, 182, 273 and 364-day duration netted yields of 12.5%, 15%, 18.5% and 19.0% respectively. I invested 120,000ZMW ($12,000) into a 364-day T-Bill and will receive 142,000 ($14,200) at maturity in August 2019, minus 15% withholding tax on gains. My “grand plan” is to invest an additional 200,000ZMW ($20,000) per year  into my principle account till the age of 35.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming the interest rates remain within the historic ranges of (16 to 21%) and inflation stays reasonable I can expect a net income of $30,000 per year, or $2500 per month, by 2026 (Age 35). At that point I will have the option to retire if I wanted to and still maintain a very good quality of life. In terms of PPP, my net monthly income from capital gains alone should be the equivalent of roughly $5,500 in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming things don’t go according to plan I could delay retirement for another 5 to 7 years (lame) and call it quits in my early 40s. Either way, I now have a clear plan to get out of the rat race in at most a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment 2- US Company Stocks. (2018 - 2026)**

I’m in the process of completing paperwork which will allow me to purchase stocks from several US Based exchanges. As a non-resident “alien” I will not be required to pay any US capital gains tax (yay).

&amp;#x200B;

I have done research on a handful of companies which I intend to hold value stocks for relatively long-term gains. This won’t be my primary investment but merely a backup in case my local currency was to go to hell or something crazy happened (#TIA).

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on beginning with a modest amount of $3000 in 2018 and based on my performance contribute an additional $2000 to $3000 per year till 2026.

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment 3 – eCommerce. (2020+??)**

Being a software engineer by profession I do intent on transitioning to selling my own products and services soon. While this is merely an idea for now I’m confident in having the bandwidth to peruse this as I gain more financial flexibility and thus free time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Variables**

* A wife and kids could seriously affect my projections. Hopefully she and I will have the same outlook on life and at least a similar income level &gt;\_&gt;
* Economy goes to hell
* Country goes to hell
* World goes to hell

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I had absolutely no plan for retirement till last year. Honestly, I still cant believe I was operating on autopilot for so long. I now have a clear goal, clear metrics to measure against and a set target date. Sure, things may not go according to plan but at least I'm no longer winging it. Assuming I hit my target I plan to spend my free time investing, volunteering, traveling, occasionally consulting and playing Battlefield.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory &amp;amp; Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a 27-year-old male who lives in Zambia, a southern African country you probably haven’t heard of and that’s a good thing. I’m a Software Engineer by profession and have been working since the age of 21. During this time, I have been able to complete my master’s degree (2016) and buy my own plot of land for 118,000ZMW/$11,800 (2017). I have zero debt and I’m also the primary breadwinner supporting both my parents (retired with no passive income) and a sibling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My countries economy is primarily cash based. Most items, including cars and property, must be bought up-front with very little wiggle room. Credit cards are extremely rare and debit cards are the norm. Several banks and institutions do offer mortgages however they are ridiculously expensive, and most individuals don’t bother with them and construct their houses over a period of 2 to 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take home salary is around $2,900 per month, it terms of PPP that’s equivalent to netting $7,700 in the USA (&lt;a href=""http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/""&gt;http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/&lt;/a&gt;). Locally, it’s a significant amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current net worth is 368,000ZMW/$36,800 or in $98,000 PPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awakening (2017)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being financially independent or retiring early was a completely foreign concept for me till early 2017. At this point in time I got a job at a bank and it completely changed the way I looked at finances and income in general. For starters, everyone was much older than me (average age of 55 in the IT department, I kid you not) and by extension already planning for (if not already transitioning into) retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this organization, every other member of staff was either the owner of multiple rental properties or a farmer. Furthermore, working with the Financial Markets department introduced me to government bonds and securities, which were a safe and lucrative form of investment. Being exposed to all of this made me feel like I was sleeping at the wheel and just coasting through life (despite being relatively “successful” for my age).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have since formulated an “investment roadmap” and created a detailed budget with all projected monthly incomes and expenses laid-out  till December 2026 (Age 35).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1 - No Rent and less family expenses (2018 - 2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 is to get the heck out of my parents’ house and into my own home. Yes, I still live with them which is a drag, but it also allows me to save 70% of my net income &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;. As mentioned earlier, I am the sole bread winner and cover 80% of all family expenses, my mums Cake business tops out the rest. Regardless, I am beginning construction of my house this October and expect to wrap up by Mid-2019. Once complete I will move out and won’t be burdened by rent. The total cost of construction will likely top out at 400,000ZMW ($40,000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I will help my parents complete a rental property which is currently at roof level. I have already contributed to this project in the past and when all is said and done I would have contributed about $8000 in total. Apart from my parents owning 1 rental property by the end of 2019 they will also begin constructing two more structures once they receive their full retirement benefits in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, my parents will be able to support themselves and I should be able to continue saving at least 65% of my take home salary in 2019 and beyond (Age 28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 – Government Treasury bills (2018 - 2026)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2018, Treasury Bills of 91, 182, 273 and 364-day duration netted yields of 12.5%, 15%, 18.5% and 19.0% respectively.

Retired at age 52, just turned 55.  I had been posting in a Morningstar forum about retiring and there were SO many people who said I didn't have enough money to retire so early.   So far, it's going great.

&amp;#x200B;

Started this year at $433k in IRA, withdrew $15.5k, and I'm back up to $436k now.  I don't plan on ever touching ROTH.  I have 4 more 72t withdrawals from IRA to do @ $15,5k.  When I hit 59.5 I'll up that to $24k.  When I get to age 62 and SS, I'll increase to $33600 ($2800 per month).  All of this doesn't include the $115k that I have in taxable brokerage that will supplement my income and for extras like travel and home repairs.  Using this type of spreadsheet for the taxable account that lists every single month, includes withdrawals, dividends and the 72t deposits, it shows $88k left at age 59.5, currently withdrawing $28,800 ($2400 per month). 

&amp;#x200B;

I play with the numbers here, percentage returns, amount of withdrawals, etc.   At the beginning of each year I can enter the actual starting numbers, like I do monthly with the taxable account spreadsheet.  I'm not rich but I can surely afford to not work anymore and isn't that the goal of being FI?

I have 4 more 72t withdrawals from IRA to do @ $15,5k.  When I hit 59.5 I&amp;#39;ll up that to $24k.  When I get to age 62 and SS, I&amp;#39;ll increase to $33600 ($2800 per month).  All of this doesn&amp;#39;t include the $115k that I have in taxable brokerage that will supplement my income and for extras like travel and home repairs.  Using this type of spreadsheet for the taxable account that lists every single month, includes withdrawals, dividends and the 72t deposits, it shows $88k left at age 59.5, currently withdrawing $28,800 ($2400 per month). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play with the numbers here, percentage returns, amount of withdrawals, etc.   At the beginning of each year I can enter the actual starting numbers, like I do monthly with the taxable account spreadsheet.  I&amp;#39;m not rich but I can surely afford to not work anymore and isn&amp;#39;t that the goal of being FI?&lt;/p&gt;

The reading list of this subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/books ) is truly filled with many inspirational books on FI. Recently, I read “Your Money or Your Life” by Vicki Robin, which tells the story of how people are constantly trading their life energy for money, and how they, perhaps without even realizing it, are valuing money over life.
 
Mrs. Robin explains that by prioritization, FI-thinking and investing, you will be able to escape the endless trade-off of money vs. life and instead, be able to chose both.
 
I think that it’s a great read, with many important takeaways, so I wish to share a few. Here’s a list of my top 10 (in no specific order):

1. Money is life energy
2. “More” is a chase with an endless horizon. You must therefore decide your own “Enough”.
3. Research has shown that beyond a certain point, around $75,000 per year, more money does not equal more happiness. (Please see this Princeton report https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/deaton_kahneman_high_income_improves_evaluation_August2010.pdf )
EDIT: As some people have accurately pointed out, this is an old number and the number might differ depending on where you live. They miss the point though, which is that there is a certain level (achievable, if given time, for most people) where more money is not the answer to your problems. The point is that this level exists, a discussion about whether this occurs at $75,000 or $100,000 matters less. 
4. Maximize your hourly income. Other activities are often more useful than your paid work as personal functions (contributing to society, socializing, personal development etc.). Therefore, make sure that the hours you spend doing paid work are worthwhile.
5. Create your own wall chart, where you track income and expenses monthly
6. Stop consuming to impress others! In best case, they won’t even notice it, because they are also busy trying to impress others. In worst case, they’ll resent you for one-upping them.
7. Ask yourself this about each expense category: Did I receive fulfillment in proportion to life energy spent?
8. Put your capital in assets that generate investment income – such as index funds, bonds and real estate
9. Once investment income equals monthly expenses, you no longer need to choose between life and money, you can have both!
10. Have money talks. This subreddit is a great place for it, but don’t forget to have it with your friends, partner and family members too.

There are many sources online where you can get the book. If possible, I would recommend getting a hard-copy (or kindle) together with an audio. I’ve found a couple of other entertaining summaries that could be useful for understanding the main points from the book as well, if you don’t enjoy reading, and/or prefer short summaries over 300-pagers:

**Life Situation:**  Married **Filing** Jointly, 3 kids 5/3/2, LCOL, Net worth is $264,949 we spend about $45,000 a year 

**FIRE Progress:** I am Just starting out at 32 (m). I have been saving money for some time but never knew a thing about Fire until around a year ago. I got married when i was 24 SO is the same age. Bought a house a year before we got married  ($75,300) paid if off when I was 30. Looking back I wish that we didn't pay it off and put the money in the stock market but knowing my house is paid off and I don't have to ever worry about losing my house to foreclosure is worth it to me. I think we are about a quarter of the way there. SO doesn't want to retire anytime soon. 

**Gross Salary/Wages:** 50,000 plus a lot of over time (probably make 100,000 this year)  / SO 45,000 salary she is a receptionist/shipping and receiving for a mom and pop company and loves it.

**Yearly Savings Amounts:** my 401k has about 38,845.33 in target date 2050 company matches 6%, I put in 355.77 ever week, SO 401k is at $9,500 she put $50 a week. my IRA has about 9,309.5, I put in about 458.34 a month SO has about $33,000 and she put $100 a month 
**Other Ordinary Income:** SO is a photographer and only does a couple of things a year. It's mostly a hobby of hers but she makes about $3,000 - $4,000

**Rental Income, Actual Expenses, and Depreciation:** Trying to get this going but can't find the right house.

**Current expenses:** Taxes are about $3,200 a year and insurances is about $1,100 a year on house. no house payment. 

**Expected ER expenses:** would like to go on vacation when ER. Looking at about 5,000 per year to spend on vacation.

**Assets: $122,000**  house, **$10,000** Nissan 240 SX SE  1998 with a SR20DET (THIS is the Japanese motor). I know this is not an asset for most ppl but I have been offered 3 different times more than 10,000 and it's getting rare and rare ever time some kid thinks he can drift like the ppl in fast and the furious Tokyo drift and crash them.  I have four bank accounts one is the house account:$18,763, my saving: $10,315, car account:$1,700 and my SO account :$6,977. The only other account is my kid's CD ladder:$12,727 (wife does this so I don't know the returns on this)

**Liabilities:** 2014 Dodge Durango, 20948.66, 2.74%  60 months loan, loan payment every month $374 (I pay 400 a month) I still owe $18,449.83 on it.   

**Specific Question(s):** I would like some guidance on what to do next. I looked into HSA  but don't have a high deductible health plan. I have about $16,000 a year to play with but I don't know what to do with it. right now i just keep putting more and more money into a saving account.

I never thought about Financial Independence; I was brought up that you work until you die.  Immigrant, blue collar, up bringing.  First to go to college and all that.
I’m 37 M, wife is 35 living in New York two small kids.
My family’s net worth breaks down as follows:
Cash: 50k
Investments – 870K (includes: IRAs, 401k’s, 529’s and ETF’s)
Homes – 912K  (Home and apartment that I’ve been renting out for 5 years)
Mortgage - -482K between home and apartment  (only real debt)

Net worth roughly around 1.35 Million
So why am I posting this.  I travel 2 hours to work and 2.5 hours back home for my commute.  Its starting to get old.  This sub as shifted my thinking.  Maybe there’s more to life than commuting.  
Can I retire when im 40?  45?  My oldest is starting 1st grade.  Where has 6 years gone?
I’m not a fancy guy – we own two cars that I paid 5k each for in cash.  My wife likes to take vacations - I go but hate spending the money.  But i always enjoy myself and love looking back on pictures.  

I still look at every expense and ask myself if we need anything before we buy it.  My father is in his 70's and still works 6 days a week.  I wish i was half the man he is.

Anyway - What do you guys think?  Do the numbers add up?

I had posted this earlier and then removed it as I thought that it sounded too boastful. I’m just sharing to feel included. I can’t tell this to anyone I know IRL so sharing here with people who maybe understand some of this. 

Yesterday was rebalance day, I got rid of some funds and simplified my portfolio a bit and also reallocated some cash and bonds towards equity, and, found that for the first time in my life I have more than 500k in the markets.

I’m also almost half of the way there with my goal. So it warrants a milestone post.

I feel a bit queasy at this milestone. I don’t know if this is good or bad or if it will pass. People with larger sums in the markets, does the anxiousness go away?

Im a regular 35 something software engineer drone at a megacorp. Job is a drag but pays well. I’m in the eu so all numbers are in EUR and represent the combined assets of me and my wife.

I Started 8 years ago with less than 10k.

2010-2013

Got introduced to r/fi and read the ERE book.
Saved on average 50k and got rid of expensive stuff and hobbies, got into minimalism for a bit and lived in extreme simplicity.  

This period was the most frugal I have ever been. Lived with one pair of jeans and only wore swag, ate at campus, packed food to home didn’t go out or on dates etc etc. found a likeminded woman so was easy to not go on expensive dates or vacations.

2014-2015

Got married and became a bit more reasonable about expenses, income doubled with combined finances and frugal lifestyle. Saved about 70k per year(we decided to live within one income and saved the other). I bought a small studio, which is now completely paid off. 


2016-2017

I got lucky with a startup exit and got a 300k pay off. Also started saving about 80k from regular salary plus bonus each year. 

2018

A bonus and Some stock sale round up the numbers. Total 800k. Equity:500k 

I’ve not spent a single day when I don’t worry about not making it to the FI number. Or what the number should be. I worry about the value of stocks and the interest rates and macroeconomics and the trillions of QE by ECB and FED and what it means for my next 50 years. I worry about my peers who seem to be grinning endlessly about some joke that I don’t understand.

So, just to explain myself:

I am aware of the 4% SWR and the trinity study etc. However I am thinking of a way to have enough 'passive income' to support my expenses in retirement without drawing from my investments. I aim to support myself through dividend payments. Usually picking safer low yielding dividend this would take a longer amount of time as I would have to build up a significant portfolio. To counter that I would be picking relatively stable dividend paying companies that have been beaten down by something temporary or in the news etc.

I aim to maximise the yield on cost of the shares I buy, in order to get to my desired expenses in the quickest way.

If you have heard of the Dogs of the Dow method it is has some of the same principles to that.

My dividend experiment goes like this:

**1. Buy one new stock every month**

Only buying 1 stock once per month suing the monthly savings, this is due to limitations of my income and the trading commission.

**2.Use a tax-sheltered ISA**

I am UK based so this seemed to make the most sense for a non-retirement savings account.

**3. A minimum yield of 3.4% in the UK and 4%in the US**

Need to have relatively high yields so don't want to look at anything lower than this threshold. The discrepancy is due to US taxing foreign investors.

**4. Buy at the bottom half of the stock's 52 week range**

Avoids buying at all time highs and hopefully minimises drops in stock price (this could be an erroneous assumption however!).

**5.The P/E ratio should be under 18 and lower than most of its peers**

Want to buy relatively cheap stocks that re doing well in their industry

**6. The payout ratio should be under 75%**

A payout ratio that is too high indicates that it will be an unsustainable dividend

**7.Strong company potential and a good history of paying dividends**

An important part is that the company continues to pay out dividends in the future.

**8. The current ratio should be in line with its peers**

Less fear of liquidity issues  (maybe there is a better way to measure this though?). I didn't give a figure for this rule as it seems to vary across sectors.

**9. Diversify across industries**

Need a diversified source of income, if one industry falls behind and cuts dividend payments it will be less devastating. In theory buying from different sectors should provide diversification

**10. Review the portfolio every six months**

​

See how things are performing, any warning signs, anything worth selling.

​

The companies I will look for should have the following three things:

1. **A sizeable yield** that can eventually help pay the daily expenses
2. **Good value**. I don't want to be buying any stocks at all time highs, I want beaten down stocks that are unfairly overlooked by other investors.

3.**Stability and security**. Being overlooked by others often means that the stock carries some inherent risks. when picking stocks we want to balance the risk with the potential dividend payoff. There is no point buy a huge yielding stock if it will scrap the dividend straight after you buy it!

​

For example the first stock I bought was $T AT&amp;T in May

​

I was wondering your thoughts - is it realistic? Am I missing something? How might something like this fair in a downturn.

Appreciate any feedback harsh or otherwise!

​","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am trying out a new portfolio approach and would love for people who are more experienced and smarter than me to give me some pointers, advice or criticism so I posted here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just to explain myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware of the 4% SWR and the trinity study etc. However I am thinking of a way to have enough &amp;#39;passive income&amp;#39; to support my expenses in retirement without drawing from my investments. I aim to support myself through dividend payments. Usually picking safer low yielding dividend this would take a longer amount of time as I would have to build up a significant portfolio. To counter that I would be picking relatively stable dividend paying companies that have been beaten down by something temporary or in the news etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aim to maximise the yield on cost of the shares I buy, in order to get to my desired expenses in the quickest way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have heard of the Dogs of the Dow method it is has some of the same principles to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dividend experiment goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Buy one new stock every month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only buying 1 stock once per month suing the monthly savings, this is due to limitations of my income and the trading commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.Use a tax-sheltered ISA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am UK based so this seemed to make the most sense for a non-retirement savings account.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm in my mid 20s, and I've been working for a few years.

I make a salary of ~$90,000.00.

I contribute $18,500.00 to my Roth 403(b), 

get pre-tax employer matching of 10.5% of salary into my 403(a),

and additionally contribute $5,500.00 to a Roth IRA. 


.


My assets are: 

 *  Cash: ~$50,000.00 

 *  Roth 403(b): ~$58,000.00

 *  Pre-tax 403(b): ~$5,000.00 (no longer contribute to this) 

 *  Pre-tax 403(a): ~$30,000.00

 *  Roth IRA: ~$28,000.00

.


I have no plans to buy a home, or complete any other type of large cash expense, so I need to put the cash to work somehow. 


I am planning on maintaining all current contributions, and adding $10,000.00 or more annually to the 403(b) After Tax fund. As each contribution is made, I will immediately convert it to the Roth 403(b) fund. 


I understand that I need to make sure that my contributions to any 403(b) fund do not surpass $55,000.00 per ""plan year"" (I am not going to approach this limit).

.


My thinking is that this will replace my need for a substantive taxable investment account. If I need a large sum of money, I can withdraw any matured principal from my Roth IRA. If I know I will need a lot of money in 5 years, I can roll my converted Roth 403(b) funds into a Roth IRA, and wait for it to mature.

I'm still planning on keeping around $25,000.00 in non-tax sheltered accounts for easy access (I need to figure out optimal investments for this at a later time).

Am I making a good decision? 

Should I think about different uses for my extra money? 

Is there anything I should know about this process? 

Thanks!

Edit: Due to the comments I've received, I'm planning on splitting my annual $18.500.00 403(b) contributions between Roth and traditional (pre-tax) at a percentage that is yet to be determined.

I didn’t think I could do it, but thanks to this sub I’ve gone from debt to assets greater than six figures. Sure it took me years and I have a long way to go. But I know why I’m doing okay - you guys. You taught me. The three most important things you taught me are good investments, meal prep, and negotiating for what I’m worth. 

**1. Index Investing** 

Before I found this sub I didn’t know what index investing was. Because I’m not wealthy, any investments I would have made in funds would have been hurt significantly because of the fees. For me, index investing works because the fees are so low. I don’t know if it’s the perfect investment strategy, but I guarantee it’s better than leaving it in the bank. 

**2. Don’t buy lunch and dinner. Meal prep!**

I’ve made Sunday nights my meal prep time. I go to Aldi and buy everything I’ll eat for the week. Eating out once a day will cost $100+ at least. Now all my meals cost less than $100. 

Some secrets for eating on a budget are cheaper cuts of meat, beans, and a crockpot. 

People argue that time could  be spent working, but we can’t work 16 hours a day (at least productively). Put on some music, and use your meal prep time as relaxation. 

P.S. Making coffee at home will save you another $50 per week if you’re a caffeine addict like me. A coffee machine is an expensive purchase, but pays for itself within months.  

P.P.S. At the start I was too strict, and wouldn’t go out with friends to restaurant as much. I find it more healthy to indulge with friends occasionally. I like to think of it as a reward for 

**3. Negotiating for what you’re worth.**

As awkward as I found the conversations, negotiating for a raise was worth the two raises I’ve gotten. A book I read helped me, ‘Never Split The Difference’ by Chris Voss. I took two tactics from it. The first is to mention a ballpark figure or what other companies are offering, rather than what I want. For example, I’ll say company X is offering $35 per hour for a similar position (even if I’m after only $29). The second tactic is to ask for a very specific number, such as $29.85 because it sounds like a thoughtful calculation rather than something to be negotiated down. 

**Summary:** The three most important things you taught me are good investments, meal prep, and negotiating for what I’m worth.

&lt;p&gt;People argue that time could  be spent working, but we can’t work 16 hours a day (at least productively). Put on some music, and use your meal prep time as relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Making coffee at home will save you another $50 per week if you’re a caffeine addict like me. A coffee machine is an expensive purchase, but pays for itself within months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. At the start I was too strict, and wouldn’t go out with friends to restaurant as much. I find it more healthy to indulge with friends occasionally. I like to think of it as a reward for &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Negotiating for what you’re worth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As awkward as I found the conversations, negotiating for a raise was worth the two raises I’ve gotten. A book I read helped me, ‘Never Split The Difference’ by Chris Voss. I took two tactics from it. The first is to mention a ballpark figure or what other companies are offering, rather than what I want. For example, I’ll say company X is offering $35 per hour for a similar position (even if I’m after only $29). The second tactic is to ask for a very specific number, such as $29.85 because it sounds like a thoughtful calculation rather than something to be negotiated down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; The three most important things you taught me are good investments, meal prep, and negotiating for what I’m worth. &lt;/p&gt;

I am based in Australia so a Roth IRA isn’t really an option, I have thought of investing however with my current savings of $5000 into some stocks as I have been following the market using games that update in real time and are accurate representations of the market.

University/college in Australia is not very expensive and my parents have agreed to pay for mine so a college fund is not really worth it

Houses are also expensive and it’s hard to find anything under a 200k that is a viable investment option

Our first house is finally going to sell shortly and we'll be stuck with a $120,000 ""problem"" of how to take advantage of this windfall.  Here's our current plan...

​

Here's the boring part... Immediately and again at the beginning of 2019 we will contribute the following.  This will be a $34,000 contribution in total.

1. Max Roth IRA ($11,000)
2. $4,000 contribution to 529 education plan (state tax deductible maximum)
3. $2,000 Coverdell ESA (which can be used for private school)

​

Here's the interesting part.  In the state of Georgia, we have access to a 457(b) plan and a 403(b) with extremely good investment options (index funds of 0.015%).  WE can contribute up to $74,000 per year between us in these funds.  So here's our plan:

4)  Immediately complete a 100% income reduction, maxing both funds until we've burned through the remaining $86,000, which will be used to cover living expenses.  (note that we would probably re-evaluate down the line to re-consider the merits of the Roth IRA/529/ESA once we've drained most of our windfall)

​

I'm curious if anyone can critique this plan.  Most notably... would we be better spreading some of our salary reduction out in order to pay lower taxes in the few years following the windfall?

Have to pay taxes on some retirement accounts and some unrealized gains still.

**College**
I worked and paid my way through most of college. 
 I graduated in May of 2013 with roughly $40k in student loans and a net worth of -$38k.  I received a signing bonus of $5.5k shortly after.  I used the money to buy a generous gift for both my brother and sister and then invested the rest into a roth IRA.

**Job**
I work in finance for an insurance company.  My salary started at 67k and has increased to roughly $90k.  My bonus over the years started at $0 (besides signing) and has increased to $10k.  I switched jobs in January of 2016 and consolidated my pension and 401k into an IRA.  Both companies I worked for offered a generous 401k match 6% then 5% and both contributed to a pension.  My average salary was around 80k but was likely closer to 90k with bonus and retirement benefits.

**Expenses**
I predict my average savings rate is likely 70%.  Rent averaged around $850 a month and was pretty cheap because I only spent 1 year living alone.  I always had roommates and more recently moved in with my girlfriend.  My net worth may take a hit in the near future as I plan to get married in the next 2 years and probably have kids shortly after.  I did kind of splurge on a car, but I really do get a lot of enjoyment out of it.  I also spend a bit more than I should on eating out.  However, I never spend money on clothes, I always ask for this for Christmas and my birthday.

**Investments**
Personally managed investments have seen great success, I predict they are between 15% to 20% annualized returns.  However, I know these high returns are not realistically attainable forever, so I am continually moving a larger percentage into passive funds.  I hope to break into real estate investments at some point in the near future as well.

**Other Comments**
I never actively sought out financial independence, I more so had an obsession with saving and investing.  One mistake I probably made was paying off my student loans instead of maxing out my 401k right out of college.  I also fear that I made a mistake by contributing too much to a roth 401k instead of a traditional 401k.  I am mostly conflicted on this due to the potential for a conversion ladder.  I definitely want to retire early, but am not sure what my savings goal is yet and imagine that will change a lot once I am married.

**Edit:**
I calculated savings rate incorrectly.  If I do after tax and include bonus and retirement benefits my average savings rate is about 63% and not 70%.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/qqhctIX""&gt;Net Worth Image&lt;/a&gt;

We just bought our first investment property together on Friday. Wedding was Saturday, parents of the bride paid for most of the wedding and we walked away about 10k richer after gifts from generous friends and family. We own our home and have a net worth of 350k not including real estate. 

I feel pretty good about the basics, forgive easily, save money, and don’t go to bed angry. 

Does anyone have any more advanced advice for 2 newlyweds looking to retire around age 50? 

Thanks in advance, this sub has given me so much. I try to give back as much as I can. I recently signed up to volunteer at a financial literacy institute in Delaware where I can give free advice to those seeking better money management habits. 

Edit. We are still discussing plans for kids. We both came into this marriage expecting to have a kid or more depending on how we enjoy the process of the 1st. We have a great supportive family, free childcare with grandparents. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just bought our first investment property together on Friday.

I am 48 years old. Have wife and 9 year old. 

We have about 3,000,000 in a taxable investment account, 500,000 in one IRA and 500,000 in my wife's. Have about 200,000 in a work 401K.  200,000 in a 529. House is paid off and listed on zillow as worth $1,600,000.  Give or take the vagaries of the values of things, I estimate our net worth including house at about 5.5M. 

I personally choose to include that house number in my retirement estimation as I know we will sell it like any other asset someday.  I also choose to ""believe"" the trinity study and cfiresim and that I could carefully withdraw 4% on that 5M today and yield 200,000 a year on which some form of taxes (both LTCG and dividends) would have to be paid. 

Haven't really begun to study how I would withdraw it, Roth ladders, etc. etc. Still in a ""structuring my life"" mode.  We do spend a lot of money - averaging 150,000/year over past three years.. I am working on cutting that number down with my wife who is responsive but it is a journey. I was raised in poverty she was raised with a bit of a silver spoon in her mouth. I make about 350,000/year before taxes.  Wife no longer works.

I know that 150K is a lot for many families and it does plague me and I see many ways of bringing it down. I do know we would spend less in retirement than as I work just with ""retirement"" becoming my job to live more intentionally and frugally. I could see retiring in 5 years. I do like my job right now.

My issue right now is -  I am preparing to ""break up"" with our financial advisors that are currently managing all of this money. They take 0.7 a year. This works out to about $25,000 a year in fees we pay them.

I have opened up my first Vanguard account for our taxable investments. We have about 3,000,000 invested with the advisors now We also have about 1,000,000 between the two IRA's . 

I called Vanguard and they walked me through the process of moving things over. The process seems pretty simple. All ETFs can move with ease. The only things they can't move is some of/all of the 5-letter funds that may be specific to our current bank.

The challenge now is that although I would like to be in something closer to what is discussed here, something  close to  the ""lazy portfolio"" of something like 20% VBTLX, 40% VTSAX, and 40% VTIAX. 

However, because I own the legacy of the funds my advisors put me in, I can't simply sell them all and reinvest in fewer funds. The tax hit would be huge.  Still, I don't know if I should move them all over. I feel like there are too many for me to meaningfully understand and manage.

Here is a view of my holdings. Kind of freaky to put this up here but what the heck, I'm sure you have looked at your own enough to handle looking at mine.

I am considering just selling everything that is green and yellow to offset gains/losses and have no taxable capital gains. This would reduce my overall number of funds held AND it  would yield a basket of cash that I could then invest at Vanguard and begin to VTSAX and chill.

This isn't an attempt to ""Marie Kondo"" my portfolio but I do think there is too much here for me to meaningfully manage moving forward. All of that \~3,000,000 starting capital came to me in 2009 and 2010. If I had just put it all in VTSAX in 2009 I'd be beyond fatFIRE now. But can't cry over that now.

I am not a savvy investor by any means. But I do think I can manage this, rebalance a few times a year, and ride out the highs and lows. This is what years of reading this sub has taught me I must do.

Anyway, trying to take control of things and I would appreciate any thoughts on what you would do in my position. 

Should I reduce the number of funds? Should I hang onto my random municipal bonds that yield 5%? Should I keep the two funds that are yielding 4.55 percent dividends and 3.85 precent dividends? Or should I sell all the green and yellows and just start consolidating all further investments into something very tight and lazy as above? What about that massive municipal bond fund they have me in - should I just put all that in VTBLX?  

Would appreciate your thoughts, especially if you have ever had to move from money managers to ""go it alone.""

I was raised in poverty she was raised with a bit of a silver spoon in her mouth. I make about 350,000/year before taxes.  Wife no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that 150K is a lot for many families and it does plague me and I see many ways of bringing it down. I do know we would spend less in retirement than as I work just with &amp;quot;retirement&amp;quot; becoming my job to live more intentionally and frugally. I could see retiring in 5 years. I do like my job right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issue right now is -  I am preparing to &amp;quot;break up&amp;quot; with our financial advisors that are currently managing all of this money. They take 0.7 a year. This works out to about $25,000 a year in fees we pay them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have opened up my first Vanguard account for our taxable investments. We have about 3,000,000 invested with the advisors now We also have about 1,000,000 between the two IRA&amp;#39;s . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called Vanguard and they walked me through the process of moving things over. The process seems pretty simple. All ETFs can move with ease. The only things they can&amp;#39;t move is some of/all of the 5-letter funds that may be specific to our current bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge now is that although I would like to be in something closer to what is discussed here, something  close to  the &amp;quot;lazy portfolio&amp;quot; of something like 20% VBTLX, 40% VTSAX, and 40% VTIAX. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because I own the legacy of the funds my advisors put me in, I can&amp;#39;t simply sell them all and reinvest in fewer funds. The tax hit would be huge.  Still, I don&amp;#39;t know if I should move them all over. I feel like there are too many for me to meaningfully understand and manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a view of my holdings. Kind of freaky to put this up here but what the heck, I&amp;#39;m sure you have looked at your own enough to handle looking at mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am considering just selling everything that is green and yellow to offset gains/losses and have no taxable capital gains. This would reduce my overall number of funds held AND it  would yield a basket of cash that I could then invest at Vanguard and begin to VTSAX and chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t an attempt to &amp;quot;Marie Kondo&amp;quot; my portfolio but I do think there is too much here for me to meaningfully manage moving forward. All of that ~3,000,000 starting capital came to me in 2009 and 2010. If I had just put it all in VTSAX in 2009 I&amp;#39;d be beyond fatFIRE now. But can&amp;#39;t cry over that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a savvy investor by any means. But I do think I can manage this, rebalance a few times a year, and ride out the highs and lows. This is what years of reading this sub has taught me I must do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, trying to take control of things and I would appreciate any thoughts on what you would do in my position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I reduce the number of funds? Should I hang onto my random municipal bonds that yield 5%? Should I keep the two funds that are yielding 4.55 percent dividends and 3.85 precent dividends? Or should I sell all the green and yellows and just start consolidating all further investments into something very tight and lazy as above? What about that massive municipal bond fund they have me in - should I just put all that in VTBLX?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would appreciate your thoughts, especially if you have ever had to move from money managers to &amp;quot;go it alone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I would personally consider this to be a more ""advanced"" type topic in personal finance, but I hope some here will still find it interesting.\n\n**Basic Reminders About Charitable Giving**\n\nBefore diving in to some unique points about DAFs, I wanted to give a quick reminder about how charitable giving impacts your finances and taxes. If you\'re familiar with this, please feel free to skip this section.\n\nGiving money away to qualified charitable organizations (typically called 501(c)(3) organizations) allows you to claim a deduction for your contributions on your federal (and almost always state) tax return(s) for the year in which the donation was made. However, except in a small number of limited circumstances^1, the benefit of this deduction is less than the amount of money you gave away (a deduction is worth $1 * your marginal tax rate - this is about $0.25 per $1 for an average person). This means that you shouldn\'t give away money ""for tax reasons"" - the benefit you will receive is less than the amount of the donation.\n\nAdditionally, to receive any benefit from charitable donations, the sum of all your itemizable donations (mortgage insurance, property taxes, state income taxes, charitable contributions, and a few other less common items) must exceed the standard deduction ($12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for a couple). If your itemizable deductions are way below this threshold, charitable contributions won\'t impact your federal taxes. However, if you are relatively close to this threshold, a Donor Advised Fund might actually help you make it across - see below for more detail on this (TL;DR - its a basic ""bunching"" strategy with a few twists).\n\n**What is a DAF? Are the Legal?**\n\nI like to think of DAFs as your own mini ""personal foundation"". They are established as charitable organizations whose effective purpose is to store money that can be donated later to other charities (See [here](https://www.nptrust.org/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund) for a good overview). I\'ll explain why this might be a good thing later, but for now think of them as a ""middleman"" - they hold onto your donation for a period of time and later donate the funds to a qualified organization of your choosing.\n\nImportantly, making a donation to a DAF qualifies an individual to receive a tax deduction for the year in which the funds were donated to the DAF. This is true even if the money is left in the DAF across taxable years and only later distributed to a charitable organization.\n\nAfter contributing to a DAF, individuals can then make a ""recommendation""^2 to the DAF to distribute the donated funds to various organizations. While there are some limits as to who/what can qualify to receive funds from a DAF, most charitable organizations will qualify and the overwhelming majority of DAFs are able to be used as the donor intends. In this way, a donor makes an initial donor to a DAF (receiving a tax deduction), and subsequently determines the use of the donated funds (but note, there is NOT a second tax deduction at this stage).\n\nDonor advised funds [are completely legal](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds) if run properly. However, in the past, their benefits have been abused by some individuals leading the IRS to issue more strict regulation on their use and limitations.\n\n**What are the advantages of a DAF?**\n\n* Separates the timing of the tax deduction from the timing of the ultimate charitable gift - this allows donor to obtain an immediate tax deduction for a large contribution while disbursing this contribution over time.\n\n* Allows donations to grow tax-free while waiting to be dispersed (although no charitable donation is permitted for investment growth)\n\n* Allows a donor to ""save up"" to make a larger donation while still controlling the timing of tax deductions.\n\n**What are the disadvantages of a DAF?**\n\n* The DAF charges an asset management fee (~0.60%) in addition to the expense ratio of the underlying investment.\n\n* Donor surrenders legal control over the funds (see footnote 2).\n\n* DAFs may have relatively high minimums to establish ($5,000+) as well as minimums on donations ($50+).\n\n* Paperwork/administrative complexity for both the donor and recipient organization (certainly not extreme, but worth mentioning).\n\n* DAFs are not exempt from the 50%/30% of AGI limitations on charitable contributions. This means that if you donate more than 50% of your AGI in cash (30% via appreciated stock), your excess charitable deduction will be carried over until the following year.\n\n**Suggested Tax Planning Strategies Using DAF**\n\nWith the higher standard deduction under the TCJA, the incentive to [""bunch""](https://www.kitces.com/blog/deduction-lumping-charitable-clumping-tax-savings-itemized-vs-standard-deduction/) deductions is arguably higher than ever. Here, a DAF is an ideal choice - it allows an individual to ""bunch"" as many years of charitable deductions as a donor desires (subject to the 50% and 30% of AGI limits) yet distribute these gifts + interest over time. For individuals that donate a substantial amount to charity, a DAF may allow them to effectively engage in a strategy of bunching and maximize the value of their tax deductions over a multi-year period. \n\nFurther, as with any charitable donation, donating appreciated stock allows an individual to claim a deduction for the full value of the property donated while avoiding capital gains. However, a DAF may also be useful here - while it would be inefficient to donate $100-$500 of stock to different organizations, donating stock to a DAF in a lump sum allows an individual to recommend *cash* donations in smaller amounts to various charities, which reduces their administrative burden/brokerage fees.\n\n**DAF and FIRE (mostly RE/fat RE)**\n\nSince I intended to cross post this to r/financialindependence, I wanted to highlight the potential of DAFs for FIRE minded individuals. The classic hallmark of a FIRE (specifically RE) individual is a high income during working years, a high savings rate, and a long period of relatively low taxable income in retirement. Thus, if charitable giving in RE is important to you, a DAF represents a unique planning opportunity - fund your DAF in your working years when tax deductions have a high value, and disperse the funds over RE when tax deductions have less/no value. In this way, you are effectively ""harvesting"" the benefit of charitable deductions in high tax years even though funds will not be distributed until low tax years.\n\nTaken to the extreme, you could even consider the goal of ""FIRE-ing"" your DAF to provide donations in perpetuity^3.\n\n**Comparison of Popular DAF Sponsors**\n\nAs one might expect, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab provide what are, in my opinion, the ""best in class"" DAFs.

I\'m examining a complex topic here, and you really should invest the time to read it in detail if you are interested.\n\nO.K. fine, but I warned you: A DAF is a ""charity middleman"" that lets you take a tax deduction today while distributing funds in the future. This lets you choose when to get a big tax deduction and can help you plan your taxes better.\n\n___\n**Footnotes**\n\n^1 In some cases, a charitable deduction actually can be justified solely on economic grounds. For instance, some states allow certain types of charitable contributions to be counted as a *credit* against your state taxes while still allowing you to claim an itemized deduction for such contributions on your federal return. This drives the cost of a charitable contribution down to a very low/potentially *negative* level. While these cases are rare, you should know that they exist. As examples, Arizona allows a $1 per $1 state tax credit (up to ~$1,000) for tax deductible donations made to certain private schools. Virginia allows an ~$0.60 per $1 state tax credit for tax deductible donations made to certain community based organizations. Especially given the TCJA\'s limitation on SALT, reduction in state taxes may now even be able to be achieved without sacrificing any of the federal deductibility of SIT.\n\n^2 Note that to obtain a tax deduction, an individual must surrender control over the property/cash donated. Thus, legal ownership of the funds resided with the DAF once a donation is made. Donors do not control the ultimate disbursement of funds and instead merely act as advisers. While major DAFs are exceptionally good at honor a donor\'s intention, you should understand that you have surrendered legal control rights upon transfer to a DAF.\n\nThis logic also helps explain the types of donations a DAF won\'t make - basically any donation where you would receive a personal benefit (charity banquet ticket, etc...). Further, you should be careful when using DAF funds to fulfill a ""pledge"" that you\'ve made. If the pledge represents a legally binding obligation instead of merely an intent to take a future action, a DAF may not be able to release the money to the organization. This can often be solved with wording - communicating to your charity of choice that you aren\'t making a pledge but are instead including them in your planned future charitable giving.\n\n^3 Although note that DAFs are required, in the aggregate, to distribute ~5% of their assets per year. Thus it is possible that, if the fund as a whole fails to meet this target, the DAF might force you to distributed assets from your ""account"" with the DAF to help them meet this requirement. Currently, this does not appear to be an important constraint on popular DAFs with distribution rates well in excess of 5%.', 'author_fullname': 't2_ixgla', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'An Analysis of Charitable Giving Using Donor Advised Funds', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/personalfinance', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'Taxes', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_996iam', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 94, 'domain': 'self.personalfinance', 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Taxes', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 94, 'approved_by': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1534910704.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'contest_mode': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to discuss the purpose and potential use(s) of charitable giving via a &amp;quot;donor advised funds&amp;quot; (DAF). I would personally consider this to be a more &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; type topic in personal finance, but I hope some here will still find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Reminders About Charitable Giving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before diving in to some unique points about DAFs, I wanted to give a quick reminder about how charitable giving impacts your finances and taxes. If you&amp;#39;re familiar with this, please feel free to skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giving money away to qualified charitable organizations (typically called 501(c)(3) organizations) allows you to claim a deduction for your contributions on your federal (and almost always state) tax return(s) for the year in which the donation was made. However, except in a small number of limited circumstances&lt;sup&gt;1,&lt;/sup&gt; the benefit of this deduction is less than the amount of money you gave away (a deduction is worth $1 * your marginal tax rate - this is about $0.25 per $1 for an average person). This means that you shouldn&amp;#39;t give away money &amp;quot;for tax reasons&amp;quot; - the benefit you will receive is less than the amount of the donation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, to receive any benefit from charitable donations, the sum of all your itemizable donations (mortgage insurance, property taxes, state income taxes, charitable contributions, and a few other less common items) must exceed the standard deduction ($12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for a couple). If your itemizable deductions are way below this threshold, charitable contributions won&amp;#39;t impact your federal taxes. However, if you are relatively close to this threshold, a Donor Advised Fund might actually help you make it across - see below for more detail on this (TL;DR - its a basic &amp;quot;bunching&amp;quot; strategy with a few twists).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a DAF? Are the Legal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think of DAFs as your own mini &amp;quot;personal foundation&amp;quot;. They are established as charitable organizations whose effective purpose is to store money that can be donated later to other charities (See &lt;a href=""https://www.nptrust.org/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a good overview). I&amp;#39;ll explain why this might be a good thing later, but for now think of them as a &amp;quot;middleman&amp;quot; - they hold onto your donation for a period of time and later donate the funds to a qualified organization of your choosing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Importantly, making a donation to a DAF qualifies an individual to receive a tax deduction for the year in which the funds were donated to the DAF. This is true even if the money is left in the DAF across taxable years and only later distributed to a charitable organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After contributing to a DAF, individuals can then make a &amp;quot;recommendation&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the DAF to distribute the donated funds to various organizations. While there are some limits as to who/what can qualify to receive funds from a DAF, most charitable organizations will qualify and the overwhelming majority of DAFs are able to be used as the donor intends. In this way, a donor makes an initial donor to a DAF (receiving a tax deduction), and subsequently determines the use of the donated funds (but note, there is NOT a second tax deduction at this stage).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donor advised funds &lt;a href=""https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds""&gt;are completely legal&lt;/a&gt; if run properly. However, in the past, their benefits have been abused by some individuals leading the IRS to issue more strict regulation on their use and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the advantages of a DAF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separates the timing of the tax deduction from the timing of the ultimate charitable gift - this allows donor to obtain an immediate tax deduction for a large contribution while disbursing this contribution over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allows donations to grow tax-free while waiting to be dispersed (although no charitable donation is permitted for investment growth)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allows a donor to &amp;quot;save up&amp;quot; to make a larger donation while still controlling the timing of tax deductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the disadvantages of a DAF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DAF charges an asset management fee (~0.60%) in addition to the expense ratio of the underlying investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donor surrenders legal control over the funds (see footnote 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAFs may have relatively high minimums to establish ($5,000+) as well as minimums on donations ($50+).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paperwork/administrative complexity for both the donor and recipient organization (certainly not extreme, but worth mentioning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAFs are not exempt from the 50%/30% of AGI limitations on charitable contributions. This means that if you donate more than 50% of your AGI in cash (30% via appreciated stock), your excess charitable deduction will be carried over until the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested Tax Planning Strategies Using DAF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the higher standard deduction under the TCJA, the incentive to &lt;a href=""https://www.kitces.com/blog/deduction-lumping-charitable-clumping-tax-savings-itemized-vs-standard-deduction/""&gt;&amp;quot;bunch&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; deductions is arguably higher than ever. Here, a DAF is an ideal choice - it allows an individual to &amp;quot;bunch&amp;quot; as many years of charitable deductions as a donor desires (subject to the 50% and 30% of AGI limits) yet distribute these gifts + interest over time. For individuals that donate a substantial amount to charity, a DAF may allow them to effectively engage in a strategy of bunching and maximize the value of their tax deductions over a multi-year period. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further, as with any charitable donation, donating appreciated stock allows an individual to claim a deduction for the full value of the property donated while avoiding capital gains. However, a DAF may also be useful here - while it would be inefficient to donate $100-$500 of stock to different organizations, donating stock to a DAF in a lump sum allows an individual to recommend &lt;em&gt;cash&lt;/em&gt; donations in smaller amounts to various charities, which reduces their administrative burden/brokerage fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAF and FIRE (mostly RE/fat RE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I intended to cross post this to &lt;a href=""/r/financialindependence""&gt;r/financialindependence&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to highlight the potential of DAFs for FIRE minded individuals. The classic hallmark of a FIRE (specifically RE) individual is a high income during working years, a high savings rate, and a long period of relatively low taxable income in retirement. Thus, if charitable giving in RE is important to you, a DAF represents a unique planning opportunity - fund your DAF in your working years when tax deductions have a high value, and disperse the funds over RE when tax deductions have less/no value. In this way, you are effectively &amp;quot;harvesting&amp;quot; the benefit of charitable deductions in high tax years even though funds will not be distributed until low tax years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taken to the extreme, you could even consider the goal of &amp;quot;FIRE-ing&amp;quot; your DAF to provide donations in perpetuity&lt;sup&gt;3.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison of Popular DAF Sponsors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one might expect, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab provide what are, in my opinion, the &amp;quot;best in class&amp;quot; DAFs. Importantly, these funds are run by legally distinct entities - i.e. Vanguard Charitable is distinct from Vanguard, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chart below summarized the key minimums/fees for each provider.

My goal was and still is Phase 2, the phase where passive and active income are so consistent you really are free to choose your destiny.

I'm very interested in starting my journey to FI/RE and I think if I focus for the next few years I can put myself in a good position for it.

I just turned 24 years old and I work in consulting and make 85k a year. I currently have about 4k in cash, 5k in a brokerage and around 8k in my 401k.

One of the perks of traveling for work is per diem, so I'm getting $200 a week additional untaxed and I only spend about $100 of that while on the road for food. 

My rent is also very low right now, I just moved into a house with some friends and I currently pay $650 for my share. Expenses other than this are about $150 for utilities and cable, etc a month. Healthcare is around $150 a month as well. I go out every weekend and probably spend $50 a night on the weekends. 

My only major hobbies are mountain biking and skiing and at the moment I have all the gear I need for the next few years, except for upgrading clothing as it wears out.

I'm putting 7% into my 401k and my employer matches up to 5% of my salary into my 401k at the end of each year, an additional 4.2k a year. 

Some of my current goals are:

- buy a used luxury car in a few years (around 30k)

- design and build a small home in a few years

- house hack a duplex

I would appreciate it if someone could give me advice on where I should be allocating my leftover cash after each paycheck between my brokerage, cash accounts and 401k (I'm not too keen on adding more to the 401k though), and how I should go about preparing for some of my future goals.

I have asked the below on /r/UKPersonalFinance, and got some useful answers, but I'd be interested to know the thoughts of the FI community on the below too, since financial independence is ultimately my reason for investing. I appreciate that most of you will be based across the pond in the good ol' US of A, but I thought there might be some UK FI users too!

==

I am a UK based investor and I currently have around £30k invested in stocks and shares ISA, specifically in Vanguard's Life Strategy 100 fund (""LS100"") using Vanguard's platform. I contribute around £1.5k a month to this and plan to keep making these regular contributions. I invest using Vanguard's own investment platform.

However, I am uncomfortable with LS100s UK bias and would like to use a fund which aims to track a global weighted index (i.e. with UK equities making up around 6%, rather than the \~25% in the LS100).

Based on my own research, my options look to include:

* Vanguard's [FTSE global all cap index fund](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-accumulation-shares?intcmpgn=equityglobal_ftseglobalallcapindexfund_fund_link) (""Vanguard FTSE Global"") which seeks to track the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap Index. The OCF is 0.24 as against LS100's OCF of 0.22.
* HSBC FTSE All World Index Fund C caught my eye since it aims to track the FTSE All-World Index and the OCF is 0.18%. Though this is quite a new fund so I am slightly unsure. Could tracking error be an issue?
* I am not keen on Fidelity Index World P Acc, since the index it tracks, MSCI World Index does not include Emerging Markets (unless I've got that wrong).

**Question 1**: What fund would you suggest I switch to? I'd be grateful for any suggestions and input, it needn't relate to the HSBC or Fidelity examples I've given. Nor does it need to be a Vanguard fund as I am considering switching to a new platform (see question 2).

I know I could achieve a slightly lower OCF by creating my own blend of funds (perhaps (i) developed world ex UK; (ii) developed world; and (iii) emerging markets). However, given the relatively modest size of my portfolio at this stage, I am not sure this is worth the hassle given my plan to contribute monthly and the need to re-balance etc. Interested in your thoughts however.

**Question 2**: given the size of my portfolio and Vanguard's ongoing investment platform charge of 0.15% would it be worthwhile for me to switch to a different investment platform, perhaps on which only charges a flat fee, such as Halifax which charges £12.50 per year? However, given I invest monthly, I am nervous about switching to a platform that charges transaction costs etc, when Vanguard does not. Any thoughts or comments grateful received!

Last year I decided i wanted to keep a ""Financial Journal"" on my progress as I attempt to FI/RE. A Couple quick changes. I was doing this initially at the end of the year but since i want to retire by a certain age I've decided to do my yearly review around my birthday (yesterday). Links to my previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6cvslo/just_crossed_100k_net_worth_wanted_to_share_my/)

I'm going to copy and paste most of it here though. So here is my 2018 / 27 year old update. I'm a bit behind my goal. I wanted to be $200,000 NW by 28 so fell a bit shy of that and I know exactly why.

Bit of background I graduated with an engineering degree from Michigan Tech and began working immediately. I never even thought about FIRE back in those day but MMM turned me on to the whole philosophy. I did have some good scholarships and minimal loans for school which helped out but here it is.

**Year 0 (2013):** Started working at a large industrial manufacturer in June full time. I knew nothing about savings and retiring early at this point. All I knew is I was an engineer and wanted to make money. I also made the mistake of buying a brand new 2014 WRX with my new income… started contributing to my 401k as soon as I started and racked up 6% company match

Age: 22

Starting Salary: $62,400

Student Loans: \~ $10,000

Car Loan: \~ $16,000

401K: $2,860

Cash: $2,500

**Total Net worth at the end of 2013 was about -$20,000!!!** Really starting off on the wrong foot! But hey we all start somewhere.

**Year 1 (2014):** Got my first real raise from an associate level 1 to a level 2. Minor pay bump up to $64,896 continued adding to my 401k and opened up a Roth IRA. Got the option of paid overtime and worked by butt off that to pay off my student loans and paid extra towards the car. **Year 1 Net Worth: $6,600 ($8,000 Cash, $600 in IRA, 10,000 in 401k, -$12,000 auto loan)**

**Year 2 (2015):** Another minor pay raise to $66,259. This was the year I started reading MMM started maxing out IRA and focused on savings. Paid off that stupid auto loan to boot!! Debt FREEEEE! One bad thing was started “playing” with the stocks and lost money in my IRA due to being young and dumb… **Year 2 Net Worth $27,500 ($2,500 Cash, $5,000 IRA, $20,000 in 401k)**

**Year 3 (2016):** Actually got a sizable 10% raise to $70,897 and was back paid to Aug 2015 so got a nice little bonus check there that went to my down payment on my first house ($124,000). Got a second raise this year (another 10%) making my salary 77,986.70 as of Sept 2016. Got married and have a kid on the way… Also started adding to a Vanguards account and HSA. My wife did work but quit her job to set up the new house and get ready for the kid **Year 3 Net Worth: $74,000 ($39,000 401k, $10,000 IRA, $2,500 HSA, $1,500 Vanguards, $2,000 Cash, $9,000 Equity)**

**Year 4 (May 2017):** Sold my WRX for $16,000 and am looking to break into the rental market, keeping excess money on hand for a down payment \~30k. Got a very minor pay bump of 2% putting my salary at $79,547 April 1st. On May 15th my son was born cutting into my HSA reserves but wouldn’t have it any other way! I did not end up contributing to my wife’s 2016 IRA but still planning on maxing hers for 2017. **Year 4 Current Net Worth $103,000: ($49,000 401k, $11,000 IRA, $3,600 HSA, $2,000 Vanguards, $28,000 Cash, $9,600 Equity)**

**Year 5 (Aug 2018):** Life as a parent has been a huge learning curve. Lots of travelling this year to see family and friends. Soon after my son was born I’ve taken a new job closer to work and with a better work life balance (July 2017). Higher base salary $87,500 and 9% 401k match, but lost the ability for paid OT. Got a tiny 1% raise March 2018 to $88,375. My wife is now a full time stay at home mother so still single income. In addition, recently acquired my first rental property. No rent as of today but cashflow projections +$400/month. Finally got into crypto. Currently down but plan to hold long term and $ cost average. **Year 5 Current Net Worth $171,900: ($83,000 401k, $17,750 IRA, $6,900 HSA, $4,400 Vanguards,** $**7,100 Cash, $5,000 Crypto and now $47,750 in equity \[Based of Zillow\])**

Biggest take away this year was that child care while not cheap was much less than expected. The media and friends hyped up the expenses of childcare astronomically. I can't even begin to understand where these estimated come from on child cost. Time.com has an article saying 17 years will cost $233,610 or $14k/year! Our spending only went up slightly this year from 40,000 to 45,000. Also I was quite fearful of living solely on a single income. Single income living isn’t ideal but it's not all that bad either. The money saved on child care costs and the fact my wife can dedicate so much time to our son is priceless in my opinion. Our saving rate may be a bit lower than expected but we are making by without a hitch. I'm a bit disappointed because we are behind the 200k net worth I projected. 1) due to crypto losses and 2) reflecting on the past year there was quite a bit of ""unnecessary spending"" that we need to improve on. I’m eager to compare next year’s growth with the addition of rental income! My biggest focus now is finding and sticking with a side hustle to help with the income. I've started a fitness blog which flopped (totally didn't have time to keep up with it) and have been streaming on twitch and reselling various fashion items. It's not bringing in millions but it helps pay for hobbies and entertainment that i otherwise would cut out of the budget.

**Year 6 goals:**

Max IRA, Max HSA, build back emergency fund up (planning on acquiring a second rental $20k) Reduce 401k contributions once it crossed 100k (focus on taxable investments and real estate) Grow the side hustles to $5,000/year gross

If you made it this far thanks for the read! I really hope these types of posts help show the power of compounding interest and help motivate/reiterate just how possible FI/RE can be. Single income with a family of 3 and should still make it to 1M by 35 It's going to be tough but adding in rentals, side hustles and soon my wife will go back part time it should all work out. Anyways long post and hope you guys all enjoyed it

Stay tuned until next year. Same bat time, Same bat channel

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far thanks for the read! I really hope these types of posts help show the power of compounding interest and help motivate/reiterate just how possible FI/RE can be. Single income with a family of 3 and should still make it to 1M by 35 It&amp;#39;s going to be tough but adding in rentals, side hustles and soon my wife will go back part time it should all work out. Anyways long post and hope you guys all enjoyed it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned until next year. Same bat time, Same bat channel &lt;/p&gt;

I recently discovered this sub a few days ago and have been reading and learning as much as possible.  I'd like to get some opinions on my situation to ensure i'm at least headed in the right direction.  A bit of background, i'm 39 and never really thought about saving or investing.  I've only done company 401K's but didn't really know what I was doing.  Basically i've been saving the bare minimum and just ""living the life"".  Spent way too much on things I didn't really need and traveled a lot (which I don't regret and still plan to do, but within reason).  Now that i'm nearing 40, I want to think more about my financial future.

Here's a summary:

**Life Situation:** Single, no dependents and live in NYC area.

**FIRE Progress:** Just getting started, would love to retire early but want to be realistic

**Gross Salary/Wages:** 125K annually

**Savings Amounts:** I have about 50K in my 401K (mostly invested in stocks).  I currently contribute 6% and my company matches 25% of that.  I have about 50K in my checking, 10K in crypto.  I also have about $500 in my HSA.  I didn't know the benefits so I never contributed much and had been using it for medical expenses.

**Other Ordinary Income:** I do rent my place out on Airbnb when I travel out of town.  This usually covers my flight/hotel.

**Current monthly expenses:**

$1800 Rent

$700 Car (550 + 150 insurance) - I have about $6500 left on loan

$100 utilities (electricity + cable)

$500 groceries and eating out

$500 entertainment (this also includes buying things such as clothes, gadgets, etc)

Total $3600.  My monthly take home after taxes currently is $6400.

**Liabilities:** No debt besides credit card debt that I pay off every month.

**Specific Question(s):**

1. Before I do anything, should I pay off my car loan right away?  Currently $6500 balance with 3% interest
2. Right now my 401K contribution is the minimum 6% in order to get the match.  Should I increase this now or max out HSA/IRA first?
3. With my income, do I qualify for a Roth IRA?
4. After doing some reading, it seems opening a brokerage account at Vanguard for example, should be done AFTER maxing out 401K/IRA.  Is this the case even if you want to retire early?  What advantage do the retirement accounts have over brokerage account?  I don't like the idea of having to wait until i'm 60 to withdraw.

I think that's it for now.  I'd appreciate any tips or recommendations.  Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Since it doesn’t seem to be clear, I don’t actually plan to just get to Coast FI and stop investing, it’s just a motivational tool. I want to continue to invest so that I can FIRE and likely even Fat FIRE.&lt;/p&gt;

Bottom Line Up Front: Where is the best place to ""park"" our money for a house if I don't plan to buy for at least 3 years? 

My wife and I are both in our late 20s, completely debt free, with a net worth of about 130k. I plan on transitioning out of the military in the next 2 years. Our savings rate is currently around 55%. 

We are currently maxing out both our IRAs as well as my version of the 401(k)---the TSP. Any money leftover goes into our Joint Account. We also have an Emergency Fund of 20k in a money market account. 

My plan, as of now, is to build our E-fund to 30k (a year's worth of expenses) to serve as a very generous cushion for my transition out of the military (and hopefully I won't need it). We will also continue to max out both our IRAs, but ease off the TSP contributions in order to start dumping that money into our Joint Brokerage Account in Vanguard (VTSAX) until I transition.

Should I avoid investing the extra ""house fund"" money into the stock market if we plan to buy in 3-5 years? Should I just park it in a money market like our E-fund? Or should I put it in a bond fund? What makes the most sense? I need it to be relatively accessible (hence not dumping it in the TSP).

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks back I wrote this post on hitting my 100k goal and how I should celebrate it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, I have switched jobs and I really needed a car to go to work. So I went ahead on a 6 month search trying to find what was **the most sensible purchase from a frugal stand point.**

&amp;nbsp;

Options being... fuel efficient small city cars:

&amp;nbsp;

- New little car for around 13k
- 2-3 year old car for around 11k
- 10 year old car, with +100k km on it for 2-4k

&amp;nbsp;

I couldn´t really make up my mind. **That I had to spend ""so much"" money on something I was not really happy with was bothering me...** I went back to memory lane, need for speed underground 2, my favorite car on that game was the Mazda MX-5. 

&amp;nbsp;

The MX-5, at least were I live, is driven mostly by older people (well kept), it is not a very popular car (not overpriced) and can be found usually with under 100k km (low maintenance). After 2 months of actively looking for it I found a 10yo version, with under 50k km, with an automatic hard-top (it´s my daily driver) and for less than 10k€. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since I have to drive for 2 hours everyday, I thought better have fun on it. Spending money on a quality product that you use everyday will just make our road to FIRE easier :) The price of that? Maybe about 1,000€ more on gas every year.

&amp;nbsp;

In a nutshell: I did not buy the most fuel efficient car, but I think I found the **perfect balance between fun and costs.** So this is my way to celebrate my first FI milestone: **don´t forget to live your life!**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm hoping to Roth convert as much as I can (or need to) when I can (I guess roll these into a Roth IRA for each of us?). 

Both of us currently do not have a Roth IRA account. But I saw something online and now I'm wondering if we should open one now ""proactively"". This is what I read, from [Ed Slott's website](https://www.irahelp.com/slottreport/5-year-rules-moving-roth-employer-plan-roth-ira) and I've highlighted the relevant difference:

&gt; Example: John, age 62, has had his Roth 401(k) for 7 years. He has no Roth IRA. He rolls his Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA. His 5-year clock for the funds will be the one applicable to his Roth IRA. **Since this is his first Roth IRA, he will not be able to take a qualified distribution of earnings until 5 years have passed.**

&gt; Robert, age 62, has had his governmental Roth 457(b) for 2 years. He has had a Roth IRA for 7 years. He rolls his Roth 457(b) account to a Roth IRA. His 5-year clock for the funds will be the one applicable to his Roth IRA. **Since he has had a Roth IRA for 7 years and he is over age 59 ½, any distributions of the 457(b) funds will be a qualified distribution (tax-free).**

So, if I'm understanding this right, I should have opened a Roth IRA years ago, even if it was just sitting there with no money in it, because it would have started the clock back then? That doesn't seem right. But if it is, does this mean that my wife and I should open a Roth IRA right away just to start the clock as soon as we can?

&lt;p&gt;Both of us currently do not have a Roth IRA account. But I saw something online and now I&amp;#39;m wondering if we should open one now &amp;quot;proactively&amp;quot;. This is what I read, from &lt;a href=""https://www.irahelp.com/slottreport/5-year-rules-moving-roth-employer-plan-roth-ira""&gt;Ed Slott&amp;#39;s website&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#39;ve highlighted the relevant difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: John, age 62, has had his Roth 401(k) for 7 years. He has no Roth IRA. He rolls his Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA. His 5-year clock for the funds will be the one applicable to his Roth IRA. &lt;strong&gt;Since this is his first Roth IRA, he will not be able to take a qualified distribution of earnings until 5 years have passed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert, age 62, has had his governmental Roth 457(b) for 2 years. He has had a Roth IRA for 7 years. He rolls his Roth 457(b) account to a Roth IRA. His 5-year clock for the funds will be the one applicable to his Roth IRA. &lt;strong&gt;Since he has had a Roth IRA for 7 years and he is over age 59 ½, any distributions of the 457(b) funds will be a qualified distribution (tax-free).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I&amp;#39;m understanding this right, I should have opened a Roth IRA years ago, even if it was just sitting there with no money in it, because it would have started the clock back then? That doesn&amp;#39;t seem right. But if it is, does this mean that my wife and I should open a Roth IRA right away just to start the clock as soon as we can?&lt;/p&gt;

Not too shocking given a healthy economy for the better part of 10 years. Consumers usually relax their frugal muscles after awhile and swap long term memory for short term. The report has some interesting takeaways though. The most jarring of which has to be the student loan numbers. Many of us know how serious the situation has become recently, anecdotally or otherwise.

Student loan debt is now accountable for $1.41 Trillion of US household debt. That's second only to mortgage debt ($8.9 Trillion). The really fun numbers come into play when we look at the percentage of loans in ""serious delinquency"". This indicates loans that are more than 90 days behind, which applies to 8.9% of student loans. Almost 9% of these non-dischargeable, tax-payer backed debts are significantly behind.

Roughly half of SL debt is in deferment currently. Meaning, 8.9% of the total outstanding is seriously delinquent but roughly 17.8% of those in repayment meet this criteria.

If any other part of our financial system had an almost 1/5 chance of being in serious danger of recouping its outlay, it would be a national crisis until it was fixed. This report highlights a few key stats to keep in mind about the current state of American households, the most glaring being that the 2nd highest contributor to personal debt is seeing consistently terrible repayment figures.

We'll have to wait and see how this works out. The numbers have been worse in past years but touting that is like being proud that you put out 10% of a fire.

HOWEVER, my parents currently live 30 minutes away from us and absolutely love our child and are petrified about us moving away.

What would you do? Once we sell our house here, we wouldn’t be able to afford to buy here again because of how out of control the market is. 

Options we are considering include:

1) taking a one year sabbatical to travel around the country and possibly internationally to decompress and possibly renting the house out 

2) ripping the bandaid off and moving at least 1,000 miles away and just retire - probably eventually go back to doing some consulting work for fun and to avoid boredom

My wife and I are in our late 20s. I just got a new job paying 70K, and my wife works part-time making 15K. This new job is a huge upgrade, so I want to make the most of it for FI.

Rent situation: we really couldn't have it better right now. My mother-in-law owns this house (but lives next door) and we pay her $450/month. Total monthly expenses are currently around $2,500.

Situation: we were thinking of moving to a different state. We'd like to get away from either of our families (relationship is a little strained with them). I work remotely so can live anywhere. But there are two things holding me back:

1. Rent is so much more expensive in other places. I want to use most of the extra income for saving for FI.
2. This is a super low cost of living area. Average rent in this town is probably $500-$700.
3. If we move, she loses her job. It's possible she could find something else though but uncertain.

My questions:

1. In our situation, would you move? Or keep the nice situation we have here?
2. Given our income, what's a reasonable amount to pay for rent?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bit of background:&lt;/p&gt;

as the title says, I'm a 21 year old who is about to go to a Computer Science major. My dad pays my rent and everything and he prohibits me from having an internship. He says (validly) that I should focus on finishing college. 

I want to achieve financial independence. I'm more than halfway through *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* and have yet to read the books in this subreddits sidebar, but I love the idea and would love it.

I minimize my expenses - I buy only the stuff I really need (clothes, food etc.) and the products that will improve my life (for example books or products to improve my social skills).

*What would be the best strategy for me during my computer science major (regarding money)?*

I could:

 - learn as much as possible (both in the area of Computer Science, sales, marketing and financial independence) and not focus on money (I'd like to work in cybersecurity, so learning the skills needed for that will take time for sure; and later on I'd like to freelance that, so hence sales and marketing and ultimately, investing)
 - try to build a passive revenue stream by becoming affiliate for example - still, I'd have to know the area I'm reviewing the products in (I'm thinking textbooks - since I'll be using a lot of those)

This may be a stupid question, but it is a big part of how we are planning towards FI.  As an example, say I buy $100 of a REIT in a simple vanguard investment account. After a year, my $100 spins off $8 of dividends, but from my understanding that $8 will be taxed on my current year’s taxes (let’s say it goes down to $5). Now I have $105 in my account due to original investment + taxed dividends.  If I sell my $105 of REIT, does the $5 get taxed again as gains?  Not sure if I am missing a key strategy or whether the government will try to tax me twice. 

If this is the case is there a way to still invest in REITS and roll dividends in so that they are only taxed when withdrawn?

I currently make roughly $20k to maybe as much as $30k a year in self-employed freelancing in addition to my ""day job"".

Goal of this post is to share where I am at today...where I want to be in 5 years...and have something I can use to hopefully keep me on track as all kinds of stuff for sure will come up to derail me.

A little about myself and my background leading up to today:

Soon to be 50 happily married going on 17 years...3 kids ages 14 and younger...currently living in a HCOL area but relocating next week to a LCOL area mainly for a change of lifestyle but a nice side effect of being able to save about $1500/month from my current expenses as well...keeping my current gig.

I make about 150K/year...maxing my 401K @ $18,500 which will go to $24,500 next year...along with a company match let's call it 3K/year.

Currently saving 2K/month in a taxable account earning 1.85%...bumping that up to $3,500/month starting in October.

450K in qualified plans (mix of MF and some individual stocks)...another 450K in cash and short term CDs earning \~1.85% at Ally.

\*\*\*my overall allocation is 50% cash/50% market exposure...some might say I need to have more exposure in the market, but 2 years ago my 3M trust fund blew up and went to ZERO- which has made me more more conservative in my thinking\*\*\*

300K in current home...rolling that into our new home next week...so call it 1.2M NW to keep the numbers simple.

I am a saver at heart...grew up in Upstate NY in a blue collar family...I still walk around the house turning the lights off...finishing the leftovers...etc.

My wife is the polar opposite...came from a family that spent a lot, went BK,  and hid cars from the repo men...so part of what I do to save money is to balance out her spending habits.

So for anyone who has a kid or kids...you know how expensive they are.

My goals are simple:

\-continue to save as much as possible to offset 3 future college tuitions (we do have 3 529 plans funded by my Mom for the kids which will help of course)

\-have 1.2M in cash/qualified plans total in 5 years when I turn 55...this is 300K more than I have today

\-not looking to RE...I like what I do...I would like to hit FI as quickly as possible, and have the choice to continue working past 55 if wanted

My wife met someone at work who is trying to FIRE and she told me about it (she thought it was a novel idea and was excited to inform me), which led to us crunching our own FIRE numbers. The results seem very optimistic, but I figured you all could help clarify.

Our current situation:

* Ages: 31
* Income: 200k/year, about evenly split. This has ramped up from \~80k 4 years ago (we have a lot of schooling). Depending on my wife’s desire to continue at her high stress job, her income could be jumping 15k/year for next 7/8 years, then to 500k. This is unlikely (more likely she tops out low 100s and cruises along). Mine will be slow and steady, with probably a 50k jump in 5/6 years.
* Retirement savings: 225k. We currently max out 401ks. With employer contributions and the pseudo-work pensions we get (not really a pension, just additional money given to us every year into the 401k in addition to the match) we are contributing \~50k/year. My 401k plan through works allows post-tax contributions (55k/year total).
* Other savings: 70k (our overall pretax savings rate is \~40%)
* House: worth 750k. 450k mortgage remaining (only debt)
* Inheritance: My MIL is open about her finances to my wife. They are currently worth 3 million and looking at an inheritance themselves of about 1 million. They are super frugal and I can imagine their net worth increasing significantly before they pass. We would be getting 50% of the estate.
* Lifestyle Inflation: My wife is getting a bit upset that people 7 years her junior are driving fancy cars and such (she understands that they are most likely driving around in their unfunded 401k, but it still grinds her gears). Knowing how much we save and how much we have, she really wants to splurge on a new car. I do not see an issue with it as we are still maxing retirement. I might get one myself when my current car dies.

The math:

* Our living expenses: My take home pay (after tax/insurance/401k) is 60k. I pay all the bills, the mortgage (40k/year, 10k of that tax) and 90% of other ancillary costs. Wife’s entire salary goes to non-retirement savings and large expenses (like furniture/renovations for house). Rounding up to be very generous, we could live off of 75k/year like kings even if we still had our mortgage. Of note, we just had a baby, so expenses are likely to go up but they will not alter our retirement contributions of 50k/year.
* Retirement investments: Plugging in a starting value of 225k with 50k yearly addition and a 7% interest rate into a compound interest calculator, at age 65 we should have 9 million. That seems…… unreal and is clearly way over what we would need.  So we started going backwards to a point that seemed reasonable. We would like another kid and asked: what would retirement look like after kid #2 graduates college? Figuring that to be about 25 years from now, that gives 4.6 million. We went down to 20 years… 3 million.
* For purposes of retirement, I am ignoring any potential inheritance and SS.   I consider them bonuses, as they are too far in the future to be any level of certainty. 

Knowing the 4% rule and such, and me and my wife being ultra conservative, we decided that we would bank on 3% WR. A portfolio of 3 million would provide 90k a year. Our current expenses are 75k (with a 40k mortgage to boot). Mortgage gone would mean expenses of 45k (ignoring tax increases).

Does this mean it is possible to retire at age 51? I am always an uncertain how to correlate expenses now and equivalent expenses in the future. If I live on 75k now, will 90k in future money cover these expenses? I am fuzzy on this, but does the 7% rate of return factor in inflation and such?

We are interested in FIRE, not really for the RE, but the FI. We are natural savers, but actually putting the numbers down blew us away. I am more excited than my wife, who doesn’t believe most of the calculations. But if our savings habits mean we can retire in our early 50s and travel the world, it would make us quite happy.

Can you all confirm or shoot down or modify our thinking here?

As the title suggests I have inherited around 200,000 euros. I don’t know how to invest it in a safe or less risky way, especially because I don’t have much experience in investing and I read that the market is in peak with a lot of debt. 

As a background I am 33 years old, I live and work in Amsterdam. I have a job that pays well, my partner also has a good job. We have no kids and don’t think of having one for another two years. I have savings of around 20K (on top of the inherited amount) so I don’t really need to use the inheritance. I am planning to travel for a couple of months using my savings, and use the inherited money for only investment for future.

If you were in my situation, what would you do and how would you invest it - with minimal risk taking, so that I can have financial independence sooner than the retirement age in The Netherlands.

Appreciate your thoughts and advise.

Combined income of around 70k gross (40k me, 30k wife)

$1200 mortgage (155k house, 4% interest rate)

Roughly $400 utilities including phones

$300 a month in groceries

Roughly $240 a month in gas

Cars are paid off

15% contribution to my 401k (was at 12% which was a little over $400 a month, currently have \~$7600)

$200 a month to Roth IRA ($325 currently)

Save $800 a month on my own into personal savings for school/emergency fund

Not sure on the numbers in my wifes 403b

No debt other than mortgage

I am currently going back to school to get my B.S. in Comp Sci and pay out of pocket for classes to avoid any debt. Because of this I am unable to contribute more to retirement accounts. My wife plans on going back to school as well for her B.S. after her surgery in November, but has tuition reimbursement through her work which would help take some of the load off. I understand that with a lower interest rate on our house we would financially benefit more to put our extra money into retirement accounts, but we plan on making at least 1 extra payment a year. We don't have a specific age of retirement in mind, but would like to retire somewhat early.

I asked about this on a daily thread a while back and was told I could ask for perspective about our portfolio, and I'm finally getting around to it.

The background here is we're still fairly unsavvy to investing and the various ins and outs of it, but had saved up a lot of cash the old fashioned (aka ""stupid"") way, which was scrimping and saving. So we have close to the top of a ""leanFIRE"" amount of money, but clearly not enough of it is invested in market-returns-level instruments (that is, we have too much cash or 3% guaranteed annuities and that sort of thing). I'm working on *that*, but I also want to know that for the stock investments we do have, are they the right ones.

Here are a few basic facts about us:

- Ages: 47.5
- Hoping to ER (or semi-ER?) in a year or so
- No children or debts; one of us has both parents, the other has neither. 
- Possible aspect of living abroad in future, due to wife being from Europe.
- Actual liquid or stock assets: ~$787k
- Assets after estimated liquidation of a house: ~$915k
- Social security benefit expected: About $1k/mo each, starting at age 70 (we haven't paid in much due to various complex yet legal reasons).
- Both working the next 12 months, hope to save $20k or more into retirement accounts.

If there is a better way to share a portfolio online with others, please let me know, but for now I'll try to use the Reddit table format. I'll round to nearest percent.

###Brokerage Account - About 63% of our money. Most of this was bought &gt;1yr ago, so considered LTCG. 

####ETFs (78% of brokerage accounts)

Symbol| Name | % 
---|---|----|----
SCHF |	Schwab International Equity ETF	| 7%
SCHD |	Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF	| 31%
SCHX|	Schwab U.S. large cap ETF	| 32%
SCHA|	Schwab U.S. small cap ETF	| 8%

####Mutual Funds (Bond funds) (22% of brokerage accounts)
(Note: My wife has today agreed to reduce our bond percentage down to like 10% after initially wanting them high due to being conservative/not trusting stocks.)

Symbol| Name | % 
---|---|----|----
BCOSX |	Baird Core Plus BD INV |	10%
PONAX |	Pimco INCM CL A |	11%

###Inheritance (some cash + interest in estate house) - About 14% of our money
(Note: house is finally on the market, so I'm just estimating low a sale price and net profit)

###Cash - About 5% of our money
We then have about 5% of our money in cash, getting 3% guaranteed interest. I'll be reducing that down to half of that or less now, though, because that seems unnecessarily conservative.

###My 403b from Job 1 - About 4% of our money
Various, but currently 62% is in a guaranteed 3% annuity (ugh; currently 9 year unwind).

###Wife's 403b from Job 1 - About 4% of our money
Various, but currently 78% is in a guaranteed 3% annuity (ugh; going to 9 year unwind).

###Wife's 403b from Job 2 - About 2% of our money
Symbol| Name | % 
---|---|----|----
FBGRX | Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund | 75%
FUSVX | FID 500 INDEX PR (FUSVX)	| 25%

###Wife's Governmental 457b - About 2% of our money
(Note: this job is now over, so she could take/roll this money at any time now without penalty, I believe)

###My Traditional IRA - About 1% of our money
Symbol| Name | % 
---|---|----|----
SCHD | Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF | 50%

**Why Listen to Me About This Topic**

I work in professional tech sales in the SF Bay area. I’ve done this for 3 years, or 4 depending if you count a less tech-oriented sales job I had in college. Out of school I had a 4-year degree, a tendency toward introversion, and a comfort level talking on the phone that I'd rank as ""nervous to order a pizza.""

11 weeks into my career I was the highest-performing entry level rep in my organization and (with help of a MAJOR stroke of circumstantial luck) was promoted to full cycle sales. Since starting in 2015, I've tripled my income and have closed / managed over $6M in revenue.

**Misconceptions: What Sales Is / Isn't**

Let's paint a quick picture: you're graduating college, or considering a career change. You love the tech sector, want to live somewhere with a ton of opportunity (i.e. San Francisco, New York, Denver, Austin, Seattle), be in a line of work that's in super high demand, and all the while earn enough of a salary to build a comfortable life for yourself and your current or future family.

I'm with you, sounds solid.

But like me, as passionate as you are about innovative tech, you're not the software engineering type. You feel like there's no chance you're going to keep up with the likes of FANG-company coders who love what they do and rake in $400k+ packages in their 30s.

Maybe you've heard of ""sales."" Scary word to some. Remember when you went to buy a used car and felt like you were getting hustled at every turn by some fast-talking schmoozer? You've seen Wolf of Wall Street. You've seen Glengarry Glen Ross. You're not that person either. So where else do you fit in the tech company or startup landscape?

Not so fast. Sales in the modern era is probably not what you expect; if you're a tech hopeful who may have written off software engineering, don't be so quick yet to write off sales as a career track.

**To Start: 6 Key Reasons Why Tech Sales May Be a Great Choice for the Non-STEM-Inclined**

1. Demand is High // In June 2018, LinkedIn published a workforce report showing that in several tech-dense areas like the San Francisco Bay Area, professional sales is one of the largest skill gaps -- which is to say that in the Silicon Valley, there are more open positions for sales roles than there are people working in professional tech sales. At least for the time being, it's a *literal* seller's market, particularly in major metros.
2. The Barrier to Entry Isn't That High // The biggest on-paper requirement to get a call back for most entry level sales jobs is a four-year undergraduate degree. Quite often your major, school prestige, and GPA don't matter much, if at all (all of which contrast with software engineering). The degree isn't even always required; I've seen entry-level salespeople interviewed and hired with AA degrees and a few years of retail experience. How you perform on the phone and in interview scenarios will be more determinant of your ability to ultimately be hired.
3. You Can Learn Sales Skills, and They're Useful Elsewhere // As mentioned, when I accepted my first entry-level tech sales job, I was the sort who was nervous to order a pizza over the phone. Cute trait when your job is basically cold calling and cold emailing 40-50 hours a week, right? The great thing about sales today is that success is by no means reserved for the ""natural saleswoman"" type of individual. Like many things, sales is a learned and developed skill, and great managers, companies, and resources (books, podcasts) can help accelerate that learning. Better yet, sales experience is transferrable, making you better at interviewing, dating, networking, and more.
4. ""Sales Skills"" Doesn't Mean You're Sleazy and Slick: It Means You're Empathetic and Can Drive Value // When I say ""sales is a learned and developed skill,"" I don't mean you can learn how to manipulate and push someone into making a decision they might've not otherwise made (you *can* learn this, but it's not what I'm talking about here). Modern professional sales is won and lost on the ability to ask great questions, listen closely to the answers, come up with tailored solutions, and reframe the way clients and prospects think about and approach their own business. The best salespeople are not seen by their clients as a pushy nuisance, but as a valuable advisor and consultant. Furthermore, while companies typically only hire a single entry-level marketer or HR coordinator at a time, it is common to hire sales reps in ""classes"" of 2-8 at a time, meaning you may be applying to a less desirable role (in terms of number of applicants), with more available roles for the taking.
5. Earning Potential is Basically Limitless // Entry level pay -- say, right out of undergraduate schooling -- is likely to be between [about $60-90k a year](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-sales-development-representative-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,46.htm) (total On-Target Earnings) in a tech-dense area. If you perform above quota, it's not unusual to be promoted within 1-2 years and approach [doubling your starting salary](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-account-executive-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,31.htm) within 2-4 years. True star performers who are aggressive about managing their careers may do this in 1-2 years, and cross the $200k mark in 3-5 years. For those pursuing FI/RE, this can be a major boon, and is probably the fastest way to serious money without additional education, sacrificing 80 hours a week on Wall Street, or successful entrepreneurship.Further, sales leadership (VP, SVP / EVP, CRO type levels) and rainmaker-level performers (semi-arbitrarily call this the top 2% of all salespeople in an entire market) have nearly limitless earning potential. I've personally known several sales professionals under 35 years old taking home around $700k a year, and have heard of top reps at major logos earning $1-2MM a year. This is an exception to the rule, but even lesser performers will comfortably find their way into the $150-250k range for much of the length of their careers.
6. Top Performers Are Borderline Recession-Proof // If you're a big-time quota-beater, you are basically recession-proof; whether it's a macro-level economic downturn or a micro-level company layoff cycle, tech companies are valued on their ability to innovate (see: great engineers) and their ability to produce revenue (see: great salespeople).In fact, in a recession, a salesperson who can still produce is even more valuable: check out the oft-referenced book [""The Challenger Sale""](https://www.amazon.com/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation/dp/1591844355) to see a longitudinal-study-turned-popular-sales-methodology revealing how and why some reps make it rain even when it seems like nobody is buying, while others (who may have been successful in better climates) fall to the wayside. Bottom-line here: if you're driven enough to be a way-above-average sales talent, your chances of forever avoiding negative outcomes during recessions and layoffs are particularly high.

**Who Should Consider a Career in Sales**

Just like anything else, sales is not for everyone. That being said, as we've mentioned above, it's also not reserved for the naturally charismatic suit-clad Chad driving a leased Mercedes type of person. So who might be suited to sales?

In my opinion, far and away one of the top qualities (which will eliminate more than half of people from the running altogether) is ***rejection resilience***. It’s said all the time that if you’re going to work in sales, you have to be comfortable with rejection, but this is no joke. I'd guess 50% of sales attrition happens in the first year, and the exodus will be mostly people who get their feelings hurt when told to kick rocks.

A next top quality is being ***reasonably-to-intensely competitive***. To lack sales drive and have no desire to better yourself, and to not have at least a friendly and healthy desire to beat your friends, is pretty much death knell for a sales career. Of the 50% or so of first-year drop-outs, I'd imagine the under-competitive is the next largest group behind those who handle rejection poorly and take it personally.

Other good traits: money-motivated, achievement-motivated, goal-oriented, an advice and information seeker, naturally curious and inquisitive, and career-oriented.

One thing that's valuable to understand about professional sales: it's not a *job*. It’s a *career*. Most professions allow you to comfortably clock in at 9, leave at 5, and not think too much about work once home. At times sales will be that, at times it may even be less than that. Generally speaking, working in sales, you will always feel like you can do more. The list of what else you can do is theoretically almost infinite. Your days are done not when a project is finished or a quota is reached or some checklist or deadline was ticked off. Your days in sales are done when you decide you can live with yourself if you went home now, knowing you did a lot today to set yourself up for future success. You will probably always have your antennas out. Within 2 years, you will be able to say you’ve given out your business card on a train, at a party or social event, in an airport, at a bar, etc. Some days you’ll wake up at 6 am to send emails and you might stay in the office until 8 pm to finish a powerpoint presentation. You might draft emails with your downtime rather than slack off, and you might take a client service call on a Sunday. Every single sales rep I know making over $140k a year has done all of these things at least once before, and from time to time many still do them regularly. You have to be comfortable with that.

**At the End of the Day, Sales Is About...**

Many people carry some sort of stigma or image of what “sales” means, and some of it may be rooted in truth or history, but little of it holds up today. In tech companies, salespeople are almost always viewed as and expected to be problem-solvers who take a genuine interest in diagnosing a client problem and providing a customized, tailored solution to fit the need. Ask any professional “buyer” and they can probably tell you the names of some sales reps that they really genuinely like and appreciate for their tenacity, work ethic, personable approach, intellect, expertise and experience, and so forth. Gone are the days of sitting in a boiler room with 30 other young aspirationals all calling curated lists with aggressive, infomercial-style scripts. Short-lived are the deals and relationships where a sales rep lied and “yes-manned” everything just to get the sale, only to leave the buyer in the dust when they realized they’ve been sold a bill of goods. This does exist, but generally speaking their success kicks off fast then peters out hard once all of their prospects and clients see them for the liar they are. Career salespeople make lasting relationships with their clients because they create value. That’s the bottom line here: professional sales in the 21st century is all about driving value.

HTH. Obviously this is one perspective / one person's experience. I can answer questions, but if you're wondering how pharmaceutical sales works in the midwest I'm in no way at all suited to give you a good answer.

&lt;p&gt;I work in professional tech sales in the SF Bay area. I’ve done this for 3 years, or 4 depending if you count a less tech-oriented sales job I had in college. Out of school I had a 4-year degree, a tendency toward introversion, and a comfort level talking on the phone that I&amp;#39;d rank as &amp;quot;nervous to order a pizza.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11 weeks into my career I was the highest-performing entry level rep in my organization and (with help of a MAJOR stroke of circumstantial luck) was promoted to full cycle sales. Since starting in 2015, I&amp;#39;ve tripled my income and have closed / managed over $6M in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misconceptions: What Sales Is / Isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s paint a quick picture: you&amp;#39;re graduating college, or considering a career change. You love the tech sector, want to live somewhere with a ton of opportunity (i.e. San Francisco, New York, Denver, Austin, Seattle), be in a line of work that&amp;#39;s in super high demand, and all the while earn enough of a salary to build a comfortable life for yourself and your current or future family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m with you, sounds solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like me, as passionate as you are about innovative tech, you&amp;#39;re not the software engineering type. You feel like there&amp;#39;s no chance you&amp;#39;re going to keep up with the likes of FANG-company coders who love what they do and rake in $400k+ packages in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;ve heard of &amp;quot;sales.&amp;quot; Scary word to some. Remember when you went to buy a used car and felt like you were getting hustled at every turn by some fast-talking schmoozer? You&amp;#39;ve seen Wolf of Wall Street. You&amp;#39;ve seen Glengarry Glen Ross. You&amp;#39;re not that person either. So where else do you fit in the tech company or startup landscape?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. Sales in the modern era is probably not what you expect; if you&amp;#39;re a tech hopeful who may have written off software engineering, don&amp;#39;t be so quick yet to write off sales as a career track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Start: 6 Key Reasons Why Tech Sales May Be a Great Choice for the Non-STEM-Inclined&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demand is High // In June 2018, LinkedIn published a workforce report showing that in several tech-dense areas like the San Francisco Bay Area, professional sales is one of the largest skill gaps -- which is to say that in the Silicon Valley, there are more open positions for sales roles than there are people working in professional tech sales. At least for the time being, it&amp;#39;s a &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; seller&amp;#39;s market, particularly in major metros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Barrier to Entry Isn&amp;#39;t That High // The biggest on-paper requirement to get a call back for most entry level sales jobs is a four-year undergraduate degree. Quite often your major, school prestige, and GPA don&amp;#39;t matter much, if at all (all of which contrast with software engineering). The degree isn&amp;#39;t even always required; I&amp;#39;ve seen entry-level salespeople interviewed and hired with AA degrees and a few years of retail experience. How you perform on the phone and in interview scenarios will be more determinant of your ability to ultimately be hired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You Can Learn Sales Skills, and They&amp;#39;re Useful Elsewhere // As mentioned, when I accepted my first entry-level tech sales job, I was the sort who was nervous to order a pizza over the phone. Cute trait when your job is basically cold calling and cold emailing 40-50 hours a week, right? The great thing about sales today is that success is by no means reserved for the &amp;quot;natural saleswoman&amp;quot; type of individual. Like many things, sales is a learned and developed skill, and great managers, companies, and resources (books, podcasts) can help accelerate that learning. Better yet, sales experience is transferrable, making you better at interviewing, dating, networking, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Sales Skills&amp;quot; Doesn&amp;#39;t Mean You&amp;#39;re Sleazy and Slick: It Means You&amp;#39;re Empathetic and Can Drive Value // When I say &amp;quot;sales is a learned and developed skill,&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t mean you can learn how to manipulate and push someone into making a decision they might&amp;#39;ve not otherwise made (you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; learn this, but it&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m talking about here). Modern professional sales is won and lost on the ability to ask great questions, listen closely to the answers, come up with tailored solutions, and reframe the way clients and prospects think about and approach their own business. The best salespeople are not seen by their clients as a pushy nuisance, but as a valuable advisor and consultant. Furthermore, while companies typically only hire a single entry-level marketer or HR coordinator at a time, it is common to hire sales reps in &amp;quot;classes&amp;quot; of 2-8 at a time, meaning you may be applying to a less desirable role (in terms of number of applicants), with more available roles for the taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earning Potential is Basically Limitless // Entry level pay -- say, right out of undergraduate schooling -- is likely to be between &lt;a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-sales-development-representative-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,46.htm""&gt;about $60-90k a year&lt;/a&gt; (total On-Target Earnings) in a tech-dense area. If you perform above quota, it&amp;#39;s not unusual to be promoted within 1-2 years and approach &lt;a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-account-executive-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,31.htm""&gt;doubling your starting salary&lt;/a&gt; within 2-4 years. True star performers who are aggressive about managing their careers may do this in 1-2 years, and cross the $200k mark in 3-5 years. For those pursuing FI/RE, this can be a major boon, and is probably the fastest way to serious money without additional education, sacrificing 80 hours a week on Wall Street, or successful entrepreneurship.Further, sales leadership (VP, SVP / EVP, CRO type levels) and rainmaker-level performers (semi-arbitrarily call this the top 2% of all salespeople in an entire market) have nearly limitless earning potential. I&amp;#39;ve personally known several sales professionals under 35 years old taking home around $700k a year, and have heard of top reps at major logos earning $1-2MM a year. This is an exception to the rule, but even lesser performers will comfortably find their way into the $150-250k range for much of the length of their careers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top Performers Are Borderline Recession-Proof // If you&amp;#39;re a big-time quota-beater, you are basically recession-proof; whether it&amp;#39;s a macro-level economic downturn or a micro-level company layoff cycle, tech companies are valued on their ability to innovate (see: great engineers) and their ability to produce revenue (see: great salespeople).In fact, in a recession, a salesperson who can still produce is even more valuable: check out the oft-referenced book &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation/dp/1591844355""&gt;&amp;quot;The Challenger Sale&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; to see a longitudinal-study-turned-popular-sales-methodology revealing how and why some reps make it rain even when it seems like nobody is buying, while others (who may have been successful in better climates) fall to the wayside. Bottom-line here: if you&amp;#39;re driven enough to be a way-above-average sales talent, your chances of forever avoiding negative outcomes during recessions and layoffs are particularly high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Should Consider a Career in Sales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like anything else, sales is not for everyone. That being said, as we&amp;#39;ve mentioned above, it&amp;#39;s also not reserved for the naturally charismatic suit-clad Chad driving a leased Mercedes type of person. So who might be suited to sales?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, far and away one of the top qualities (which will eliminate more than half of people from the running altogether) is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;rejection resilience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s said all the time that if you’re going to work in sales, you have to be comfortable with rejection, but this is no joke. I&amp;#39;d guess 50% of sales attrition happens in the first year, and the exodus will be mostly people who get their feelings hurt when told to kick rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A next top quality is being &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reasonably-to-intensely competitive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. To lack sales drive and have no desire to better yourself, and to not have at least a friendly and healthy desire to beat your friends, is pretty much death knell for a sales career. Of the 50% or so of first-year drop-outs, I&amp;#39;d imagine the under-competitive is the next largest group behind those who handle rejection poorly and take it personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other good traits: money-motivated, achievement-motivated, goal-oriented, an advice and information seeker, naturally curious and inquisitive, and career-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that&amp;#39;s valuable to understand about professional sales: it&amp;#39;s not a &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt;. Most professions allow you to comfortably clock in at 9, leave at 5, and not think too much about work once home. At times sales will be that, at times it may even be less than that. Generally speaking, working in sales, you will always feel like you can do more. The list of what else you can do is theoretically almost infinite. Your days are done not when a project is finished or a quota is reached or some checklist or deadline was ticked off. Your days in sales are done when you decide you can live with yourself if you went home now, knowing you did a lot today to set yourself up for future success. You will probably always have your antennas out. Within 2 years, you will be able to say you’ve given out your business card on a train, at a party or social event, in an airport, at a bar, etc. Some days you’ll wake up at 6 am to send emails and you might stay in the office until 8 pm to finish a powerpoint presentation. You might draft emails with your downtime rather than slack off, and you might take a client service call on a Sunday. Every single sales rep I know making over $140k a year has done all of these things at least once before, and from time to time many still do them regularly. You have to be comfortable with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the End of the Day, Sales Is About...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people carry some sort of stigma or image of what “sales” means, and some of it may be rooted in truth or history, but little of it holds up today. In tech companies, salespeople are almost always viewed as and expected to be problem-solvers who take a genuine interest in diagnosing a client problem and providing a customized, tailored solution to fit the need. Ask any professional “buyer” and they can probably tell you the names of some sales reps that they really genuinely like and appreciate for their tenacity, work ethic, personable approach, intellect, expertise and experience, and so forth. Gone are the days of sitting in a boiler room with 30 other young aspirationals all calling curated lists with aggressive, infomercial-style scripts. Short-lived are the deals and relationships where a sales rep lied and “yes-manned” everything just to get the sale, only to leave the buyer in the dust when they realized they’ve been sold a bill of goods. This does exist, but generally speaking their success kicks off fast then peters out hard once all of their prospects and clients see them for the liar they are. Career salespeople make lasting relationships with their clients because they create value. That’s the bottom line here: professional sales in the 21st century is all about driving value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTH. Obviously this is one perspective / one person&amp;#39;s experience. I can answer questions, but if you&amp;#39;re wondering how pharmaceutical sales works in the midwest I&amp;#39;m in no way at all suited to give you a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;

[Year One update]( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6tfii3/1_year_update_resident_physician_to_attending)

Hello everyone, I figured I would do a yearly update and crosspost to both PF and the FIRE subreddit. 

**THE DEBT**

Down to 362K as of today.

I ended up refinancing my loans to a private lender. I debated long and hard about continuing with PSLF, but in the end, the risks far outweighed the potential benefit. There was no guarantee that my loans would be forgiven, especially as my employer was not 501c3 certified. Even though it is considered a non-profit and provides public health services (it is an independent physician group and is not technically part of the hospital), there is nothing to prevent the government from denying the forgiveness claim.  I ended up refinancing to a 3.8% fixed rate loan for 6 years. However, I have been paying biweekly instead of monthly, and that has shaved off a significant time off of my payoff period. 

Deciding to refinance was one of the toughest financial decisions I made. It may be possible that I could have gotten my loans forgiven had I stuck with it, but I simply wasn’t willing to take the chance of my loans ballooning to a massive amount (my average interest rate for all my loans pre-refinancing was about 6.8%), and then finding out I didn’t qualify for PSLF. Ultimately, I feel better about paying off loans at a regular interval, and watching the total principle decrease. Although it’s easy for me to say I wish I had started paying off in residency, hindsight is 20/20 and what’s done is done. I’ve made the commitment to get rid of my loans, and to be honest, it feels like a dark cloud has started to lift knowing that they are finally being payed off. 

Again, I have no credit card debt, and pay off everything at the end of the month.

**PERSONAL STUFF AND EXPENSES**

Still not married and have no children. I did date another physician this past year, but she ended up moving across the country (which was in the works before she met me). We separated amicably, and I although I do feel sad, it was for the best.  My car now has 130k miles, but I’m starting to feel the pull of lifestyle creep. I can’t help but constantly look up newer model cars, and think about how much better my 15min commute would be with heated/cooled seats. I follow Doug Demuro on YouTube, and wish I had a car worthy of being reviewed for it’s quirks and features. I'm still leaning hard towards a CPO Tesla!

I’ve decided to update my wardrobe once a year, but only around great sales. This year, Macy’s had a great deal around Veteran’s day, where they had an extra 20% off coupon. Ended up purchasing a ton of dress shirts, pants, and shoes for less than $300. I’m subscribed to /r/frugalmalefashion which is where I can keep an eye out for these deals. 

I reduced expenses:

* Again called my ISP and was able to keep my 50/10 internet for $30. My modem and router have paid for themselves, so again, no rental fees :)
* Ended up joining my brother’s family plan. Cost was an extra $18 to his plan, which I pay off. Over the last 2 years, I've reduced my cell phone bill from $75-&gt;$55-&gt;$20!
* Kept my Costco executive membership and am using their credit card.  This combo essentially pays for itself through the combined 4% cash back, as well as 4% off their gas (which is already about 20c cheaper than surrounding gas stations). 

**THE JOB**

Received a promotion, with a stipend attached to it. It’s a little more administrative than I thought, but it’s providing me with an opportunity to learn leadership skills. 

**THE BENEFITS/INVESTMENTS**

* 403(b): 18.5k fully maxed out last year. For 2018 and going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year. 
* Non-governmental 457: 18.5k fully maxed out last year. Again, for 2018 going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year.
* 401(a): employer contributed. Finally qualified this year!
* Roth IRA: $5500 fully funded the beginning of every year. I have basically been setting aside $211 every pay period so that I can fund at the beginning of next year. 
* Emergency fund: fully funded. Ended up closing out my Ally CDs early since their savings interest rate was more attractive than the CD. 
* Taxable brokerage accounts: I ended up keeping only the Vanguard account open. I haven’t really been contributing as I have been saving up to purchase a home in the area. I do have 2 individual stocks I purchased near the end of last year which have done reasonably well. I’m a fan of index funds, but these 2 were “fun” stocks to play around with. 
* Cryptocurrency: I really wish I wasn’t greedy or had FOMO syndrome. I could have made a small profit had I sold at the peak. Instead, I only have about 25% of my original investment left. My only saving grace is that I did not pour too much into this, and can absorb the losses. Do I truly regret it, though? Not really…I was thankfully reserved enough not to invest too heavy, and I can treat it as a lesson learned (albeit a pricey one). 

**NET WORTH**

* Since I started calculating this in October of last year, my net worth has gone from -$311k to -$170k. Using excel’s trendline tool, I’m expecting to hit net 0 in September 2019. 

Here’s a [visual](https://imgur.com/a/tsD3VUi) of my net worth, debt load, and investment value since I started tracking in October 2017.


**THE PLAN FOR THIS COMING YEAR**

1.	Continue to max out 403b, 457, and backdoor Roth IRA. Once I save up 20% for a down payment, I’ll restart m contributions to the taxable brokerage account.  
2.	Continue to pay off student loans regularly. Currently I have under 5 years left on my loan repayments (I have been paying a little extra every month in addition to making biweekly payments). Having an auto-debit from my banking account has done a lot to ease my mind. Any extra cash I make will be used to pay off loans. 
3.	Continue contributing to nephew and niece college funds.  
4.	Since I have started making massive student loan repayments, I have been able to avoid lifestyle creep simply because I don’t have the money to do so. That being said, although I still live like a resident, I don't have to live like a hermit. I was able to afford a vacation abroad this past year, I continue to have dinners and drinks with friends, and am still able to afford the occasional nice bottle of Japanese whiskey once every few months. 

As usual, thank you for reading this long post!  Any suggestions, comments, or criticisms you can provide will be much appreciated!

It may be possible that I could have gotten my loans forgiven had I stuck with it, but I simply wasn’t willing to take the chance of my loans ballooning to a massive amount (my average interest rate for all my loans pre-refinancing was about 6.8%), and then finding out I didn’t qualify for PSLF. Ultimately, I feel better about paying off loans at a regular interval, and watching the total principle decrease. Although it’s easy for me to say I wish I had started paying off in residency, hindsight is 20/20 and what’s done is done. I’ve made the commitment to get rid of my loans, and to be honest, it feels like a dark cloud has started to lift knowing that they are finally being payed off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I have no credit card debt, and pay off everything at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL STUFF AND EXPENSES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not married and have no children. I did date another physician this past year, but she ended up moving across the country (which was in the works before she met me). We separated amicably, and I although I do feel sad, it was for the best.  My car now has 130k miles, but I’m starting to feel the pull of lifestyle creep. I can’t help but constantly look up newer model cars, and think about how much better my 15min commute would be with heated/cooled seats. I follow Doug Demuro on YouTube, and wish I had a car worthy of being reviewed for it’s quirks and features. I&amp;#39;m still leaning hard towards a CPO Tesla!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to update my wardrobe once a year, but only around great sales. This year, Macy’s had a great deal around Veteran’s day, where they had an extra 20% off coupon. Ended up purchasing a ton of dress shirts, pants, and shoes for less than $300. I’m subscribed to &lt;a href=""/r/frugalmalefashion""&gt;/r/frugalmalefashion&lt;/a&gt; which is where I can keep an eye out for these deals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reduced expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again called my ISP and was able to keep my 50/10 internet for $30. My modem and router have paid for themselves, so again, no rental fees :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ended up joining my brother’s family plan. Cost was an extra $18 to his plan, which I pay off. Over the last 2 years, I&amp;#39;ve reduced my cell phone bill from $75-&amp;gt;$55-&amp;gt;$20!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kept my Costco executive membership and am using their credit card.  This combo essentially pays for itself through the combined 4% cash back, as well as 4% off their gas (which is already about 20c cheaper than surrounding gas stations). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE JOB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Received a promotion, with a stipend attached to it. It’s a little more administrative than I thought, but it’s providing me with an opportunity to learn leadership skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BENEFITS/INVESTMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;403(b): 18.5k fully maxed out last year. For 2018 and going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-governmental 457: 18.5k fully maxed out last year. Again, for 2018 going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;401(a): employer contributed. Finally qualified this year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roth IRA: $5500 fully funded the beginning of every year. I have basically been setting aside $211 every pay period so that I can fund at the beginning of next year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emergency fund: fully funded. Ended up closing out my Ally CDs early since their savings interest rate was more attractive than the CD. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxable brokerage accounts: I ended up keeping only the Vanguard account open. I haven’t really been contributing as I have been saving up to purchase a home in the area. I do have 2 individual stocks I purchased near the end of last year which have done reasonably well. I’m a fan of index funds, but these 2 were “fun” stocks to play around with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptocurrency: I really wish I wasn’t greedy or had FOMO syndrome. I could have made a small profit had I sold at the peak. Instead, I only have about 25% of my original investment left. My only saving grace is that I did not pour too much into this, and can absorb the losses. Do I truly regret it, though? Not really…I was thankfully reserved enough not to invest too heavy, and I can treat it as a lesson learned (albeit a pricey one). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NET WORTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since I started calculating this in October of last year, my net worth has gone from -$311k to -$170k. Using excel’s trendline tool, I’m expecting to hit net 0 in September 2019. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/tsD3VUi""&gt;visual&lt;/a&gt; of my net worth, debt load, and investment value since I started tracking in October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE PLAN FOR THIS COMING YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Continue to max out 403b, 457, and backdoor Roth IRA. Once I save up 20% for a down payment, I’ll restart m contributions to the taxable brokerage account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Continue to pay off student loans regularly. Currently I have under 5 years left on my loan repayments (I have been paying a little extra every month in addition to making biweekly payments). Having an auto-debit from my banking account has done a lot to ease my mind. Any extra cash I make will be used to pay off loans. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Continue contributing to nephew and niece college funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Since I have started making massive student loan repayments, I have been able to avoid lifestyle creep simply because I don’t have the money to do so. That being said, although I still live like a resident, I don&amp;#39;t have to live like a hermit. I was able to afford a vacation abroad this past year, I continue to have dinners and drinks with friends, and am still able to afford the occasional nice bottle of Japanese whiskey once every few months. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Lots of twists and turns but all worked out to get to the destination sooner than expected.

Since, like me, most folks here enjoy stories of how people were able to FIRE I figure I’ll share the key events of my story since I put my notice in at work this past Friday. August 29 will be my last day.

I’m not sure when I made the decision to retire early. I just know that I wanted to be financially independent but thought I’d work until I was older than my current 48 years. From my first job I was careful about where I spent money, not willing to spend on a new car every few years although I certainly wanted one. When I met my now wife, she was immediately on board with this lifestyle. Six months after we started dating her house burned down. Through determination and a good amount of luck we were able to take this awful situation and turn it into a positive. We rebuilt the house much better than it was before but were able to save a lot of money as my father owned a heating and AC company and did the work at cost. We also invested the portion of the insurance for the contents of the house into stocks making about 40% return in a year or so – that is where the luck came in for sure (not crypto money but not bad).

2000 was a big year for us. We got married, my wife got a new job that came with a 50% raise (a big focus of mine has been increasing income more than decreasing spending), we bought a boat (we weren’t spendthrifts but we did want to enjoy life as we lived it), bought a vacation home/rental property with three apartments at the beach, and paid cash for a timeshare (I know what people think about them but we have used it well and will have great vacations going forward in retirement).

How we handled the rental property was important. We had two mortgages (our home and our rental property) but the interest on the rental property wasn’t deductible because our income was over the passive income limit. So two or three years after buying the house and with lots of equity in our newly built primary home, we did a cash out refi of our primary, paying off the rental, reduced the term to 15 years and cut over $500 a month from the previous two mortgage payments. Now all the interest was deductible. All the while we were saving as much as we could but still spending on the things that made us happy. I don’t have great stats before 2006 but we were probably in the 30-40% savings range based on the years that I do have good stats for.

I bought my first “extravagant” car in 2003 paying cash for an Infiniti G35 which, 15 years later, I’m still driving and have no plans for a new one any time soon. In 2004 I changed jobs at my company leading to a jump in salary.

On one of our timeshare vacations we fell in love with the southern CA desert and would visit once or twice a year. Sometime in the mid-2000s we decided this is where we wanted to retire to – at least for the winters as we’d still want to have a boat and our vacation home at the beach. In 2005 we bought a much bigger boat.

Always enjoying the investing and planning part of finances I decided to make a career change and become a financial planner. I studied for and passed the CFP exam in 2008. I didn’t want to work on commission but could only find commission based work. The common reason I got for not being hired or considered was that I had a high paying job now, why would I want to go into a new business. This was frustrating since I had planned for the significant reduction in income for the early years of my new career. If I didn’t then I wouldn’t be a very good financial planner, would I?

In 2009, with the money I had saved for the career change that didn’t happen, we bought our first condo in SoCal and used it for vacations but rented it most of the time. A year after buying that we again refinanced our primary residence paying off the CA property and reducing the monthly spend over the two individual mortgages.

In 2012 I bought into a franchise and built a business while my wife and I still had our full time jobs. In many ways this was a huge mistake (the issues that come with having over 30 employees was a lot to deal with), but once again we worked hard to make it work out and in 2017 we sold the business. This made the RE part of FIRE look much more possible much sooner than we thought, so we got to work on the final plan. Using some of the proceeds from the sale of the business we bought a second home in SoCal as our retirement vacation home. We rented it out for one season bringing in a good amount of money. Over the summer and fall of 2017 we talked, made projections, talked some more, made plans, and talked some more.

In the spring of this year we sold our primary residence knowing that by the end of August I’d be done working. Moving all our stuff made me realize that even living somewhat frugally we had way more stuff than we needed. We’re trying to reduce what we have and have made a good amount of progress but it still feels like a drop in the bucket.
Our plan is to spend September at the shore using the boat and wave runner and doing work on the rental property. In October we’ll drive across country where we’ll spend the winter returning to the shore in April.

My wife will continue working but is location agnostic. She enjoys her job so will continue as long as she can or wants. I won’t give specific figures but based on the numbers I’ve heard here on the FI subs, we’re at the low end of FATFIRE.

The taxing jurisdiction of the United States has not been changed since Tait v Cook, a 1924 US Supreme Court case. &lt;/p&gt;

Hoping to share my story and inspire others that are not working in tech.

Throwaway for anonymity reasons, I’m an active member of this community for about 2 years.

I’m 28, married, no kids yet, MCOL city in Western Canada. This is my journey to $589k net worth (household):

I went to university at 17 not knowing exactly what I wanted to do. I have a late birthday which I always thought of as an advantage during school and life. I graduated at 21 with a general business commerce degree. In highschool I worked and saved to have a few thousand in this bank as I left for school, and then in the summers I ran my own business (for anonymity reasons I’ll leave this detail out). I worked much harder at the business than I did in class. I paid my own tuition, but I had help with rent from my parents ($350/m). I graduated with $35k student debt as I paid my last year tuition in full on my own. 

Upon finishing school I had saved about $60k (almost all cash) and left my business for a corporate job, not before taking some time off to travel. After my student loans I estimate my net worth to be about $25k by the end of 2011.

My first corporate job was in sales, entry level at a negotiated salary of $39k/yr. I worked about 55hrs in a typical week and lived at a cheap apartment shared with a friend at a total cost of $780 a month all inclusive. My plan was to buy a house ASAP. It took longer than expected but the cheap rent helped save further, and during this time I drove a clunker from 1994 (this was 2011 - 2013). I bought my house at 23 for $250k and rented out a room to someone for a year to subsidize the mortgage before my girlfriend (now wife) moved in. I fixed up the house over the 5 years living in it and now estimate its value at $400k.

I performed well at my job but my raises were minimal after 2 years, finally getting an offer of a new job that had a higher salary, a variable pay/bonus structure, and company car that included gas and insurance (even for personal). Salary itself was about 25% higher and all the other perks. I have my notice, and my boss tried to retain me with a $20k raise as I was the top performing salesperson, but I still walked away. 

New company in 2013 only lasted 1 year into mid 2014, and I earned about $70k (after the bonuses) + car. I would have stayed here longer but I subscribed to job alerts to a larger company and the perfect job lined up for me that I had to jump at. Boy am I glad I did.

I took their first offer (didn’t negotiate, which is one of my only regrets) at $69k+5% bonus at target in a marketing role. I was qualified as my previous 1 year job set me up well for this new role at new the company (global Fortune 500). In reality it was a pay decrease as I lost the company car benefit, but with an organization that offered more growth and upward mobility.
After some strong work ethic and performance, I’ve received 2 promotions in the past 4.5 years here, and now am back into sales in account management. My base salary is $115k with bonus potential when above target, and a company car. Last year I earned $140k and this year I expect to earn $180k.

My wife also works and started at $30k, progressing over the past 6 years to $65k. Our household income is about $200k give or take depending on my bonus, and were able to get away with just 1 car (paid for) as she walks to work.

Our net worth is $589k based on my house equity estimate:
Assets:
House: $400k(appreciated $150k but also put a lot of DIY sweat equity into it)
Cash: $42k
Retirement savings (RRSP &amp; RPP): $133k
Tax-Free investments: $90k
Taxable investments: $56k
Crypto currencies: $3k (rode the wave up and then down, I’ve lost about 50% of my initial investment 

Liabilities: 
Mortgage $135k (2.75%)
Credit cards we pay off in full every month.

I’ve always been frugal and money conscious. I started tracking our household net worth about 2 years ago. Here are the snapshots:

March 2016: $271k net worth (first time combining my wife and I’d finances), salary about $80k and $50k, includes estimated house appreciation.

January 2017: $380k net worth (90k and $55k salary)

January 2018: $496k net worth ($105k and $60k salary, my first time solely earning $100k/year, bonus earned but paid out later in 2018, back to having a company car

August 2018: $589k net worth (bonus from 2017 lump sum paid, HH income this year expected to be just over $200K and next year higher as my bonus will be paid in 2019).

It has been so exciting watching the nest egg grow and get closer to independence. We don’t know our FI target number yet, and I’m expecting a downturn sooner than later which I’m sure will be a wake up call.

We have allowed for some lifestyle inflation, but we mostly spend on trips and experiences. We go on vacation once a year and multiple weekend getaways. We also spend more than some on food and beer/wine as we don’t forego quality of fresh/craft varieties. I haven’t outright tracked my expenses yet but I expect around $65k including mortgage payments. One of the biggest things is we am in the same home that I had while making $40k alone that we are in with HH income of ~$200k. This has allowed us to boost savings substantially. We live in Canada so probably more income tax than my US counterparts reading this, but I believe we save somewhere around 50% of our take home pay. We also luckily don’t have to worry about health insurance in early retirement. I invest in primarily ETFs, along with a few stocks. I max our employee benefits for pension match and stock purchase program. I have a small side hustle that nets a few thousand a year. I am wanting to get into real estate investing soon. My wife is more of a spender than I, but has improved significantly in the pursuit of FIRE. We seem to be able to balance quite well and never turn something down for the sake of money. We’re in the boring phase now of accumulate and look at finances once a month. We joke about how we never know when it’s payday which is a nice feeling.

I’m hoping that this post inspires some others who are of the minority here on this sub that are not in computer science or STEM areas. I expect we will be FI somewhere around 35 and RE by 40 would be the goal, but we do want kids in the next few years so I expect this is a flexible goal and will change. I’m also open to quitting at $1M to pursue something of more interest/entrepreneurial. Our costs will go up with children and a larger home, and perhaps my wife will not return to work after kids (to be decided). I also don’t expect my bonuses so we ensure we base our spending/saving around our salaries, then tuck the entirety of my bonuses (if they come) into investments. I expect anywhere from $40-70k bonus in q1 2019 which will be taxed heavily, but I plan to use the remainder on purchasing a rental property to help diversify our portfolio.
My work can be demanding and very stressful, but I realize I’m fortunate for the opportunity I do have. I guess the point here is I plan to keep up the grind for a while longer and then can reevaluate with the options that financial security offers.

Any questions please ask. Thanks for reading! I am looking forward to the day you tell me to “go fuck yourself”!

But I wanted to share my road map for FIRE as well as provide my rationale for ending the chase for Retiring Early. I'm a single 30M in sales in MCOL area in the south, turning 31 in a few months, not a crypto winner, but had some help with inheritance. Worked through college and left debt free.

**2010**\-**2012** graduated state school, with a finance degree, couldnt find work so went into sales $55k /yr and company car /w 18% 401k matching. Lived like a poor college kid and maxed out retirement funds. Biggest regret was not piling into ROTH IRA since I qualified. Received $45k inheritance from fathers estate.** Net worth @ $104k Age 25**,

**2012**\-**2013** Left first job, started new job at another sales company but took a pay cut. $45k /yr plus uncapped commissions. Ended up getting paid like $65,000 total comp. The company was horrible but basically they provided great training for my next gig. I lasted 11 months there. I lost all my 401k matching at the time due to leaving before 2-year vesting. Lived at home during this time to save on rent since I was traveling so much.** Net worth @ $168k Age 26 $25k annual spendin**g

**2013-2016** Got a new job when I still had that old job and basically jumped my base to $80k /yr. The big take away is the higher the sales role, the bigger the base. The bonus ranged from $0- $60k at the time. I also discovered FIRE around this time. I moved out when I landed the job and lived poor for the next few years and bought used furniture and stuff. I bought a shit condo but in a well managed complex for $33k. The place was nasty but after $12k of fixing it up, it felt nice and it was home for 2 years. I did the work myself for the most part and saved cash, I probably wouldn't do it again since it wouldn't have costed much more had professionals done it. It has since appreciated to $65k. After making good bonuses at this role ranging from $40k-$65k and consistent 3-4% raises, I decided it was time to buy a bigger home in a fun part of town. My typical take home was around $130-$165k these years and market returns were GREAT. **Net worth @ $522k age 29 $21-$25k annual spending**

**2016-2018** My parents wanted to give me a gift when they heard I wanted to buy a bigger home. So I was very fortunate to receive from them a $30k as a down payment for a $315k home. I rented out my old condo for $860/mo and net around $5k a year in net income. I rent out a furnished bedroom in my new home for $900/mo with 6 month leases. Appreciation in the home was minimal, $15k so far. In addition, I got promoted at work and went from my prior role's salary of $89k to around $103k with the same bonus structure. The last years bonus was $0 and I was disappointed however, I am still grinding away to hopefully see the same kind of bonus from prior years. However, total take home pay even in a no bonus year is around $115k due to 401k matching, small cash payouts, stock purchase program, condo rental income. **Net worth @ 810k Age 30/31 $40k annual spending**

**2018-2019** I don't like to count my chickens before they hatch but I would probably suspect that my ending NW in 2019 would be shy of $1M. I believe I can put away $25k the remainder of this year and another $90k next year. If the market does 7-8% return I'd be happy. **????Net worth @ $990k Age 32??????**

**FIRE ""day dreaming"" as a method of coping with stress and anxiety.** I read a prior post on this sub about how the OP used FIRE as a way to escape the stress and anxiety from his work. After reading that, I completely knew what he was talking about. Whenever I get stressed or anxious, I day dream about FIRE and it helps. Daydreaming isn't healthy for me and I sought professional help. After visiting a psychiatrist, I was prescribed several meds that have made me feel really good about what I do and have reduced the stress and anxiety down to a minimum. Therefore, I believe I will work well into my 40s or 50s. I had originally wanted to quit at 35-38 years old. But I realize, I'm really good at talking to people and sales in general. So why waste my talents, unless I find something else I'd rather do.

**BaristaFI isnt a great option unless there's ample flexibility for time off &amp; health benefits.** I used to think I could take a retail or coffee shop job to just coast since in 10 years, my NW would be \~$2M. However, working menial jobs is still working a job. Unless I could come and go as I please, why get paid $20k vs $50k for a professional desk job that has health benefits.

**Its been a wonderful learning experience but RE isnt for me.** I learned a ton on this sub but the most valuable was learning that RE isnt for me. I would be so bored and I would probably fall into depression. Plus the new meds I am taking help with new perspectives and have made my life that I am living a decent one. I am glad I didn't suffer until 38 and FIRE then realize ""fuck I'm still depressed and bored"". This my ""build the life you want then save for it"" but I'm just building the life I want and spending whatever the fuck I want because I've already saved up :)

**Projects &amp; further research.** I am a big fan of back testing FIRE withdraw rates and spending patterns in retirement. The subject matter fascinates me. I love reviewing scenarios for people with car payments and understanding how it should be calculated into the withdraw rate since its a temporary (1-5 year loan cost) and how to calculate for 30 years for car expenditures. Rental property and how they factor into FIRE withdraws. Do you use the full equity or just the net income from rent? Isn't a rental property like a bond? Can we use both the equity and net income as part of the FIRE equation? Or just one or the other? What about divorce and how assets will be split. If I am 35 and achieve $1.5M in assets, how much of that will be owed to my divorced spouse? All this fascinates me and I hope to continue reading the subreddit as experts chime in.

**LEAN FIRE is probably going to fail for most folks.** I'm just calling this out right now. If someone has no room in their lean budget to adjust for bad times or for unexpected medical/costs, this idea will fail. Its not just ""3% or sub 4% withdraw"", its if you can slash you spend overnight as assets fall and how long can you sustain those lower withdraws. No one is 25 forever if they are planning to LEAN FIRE.

To everyone pursing FI, its a great feeling to not be worried about the next paycheck. To the folks who are pursing Early Retirement, good luck but make sure you aren't using it as a coping mech for your current stresses and anxiety now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long time lurker, throw away account. But I wanted to share my road map for FIRE as well as provide my rationale for ending the chase for Retiring Early. I&amp;#39;m a single 30M in sales in MCOL area in the south, turning 31 in a few months, not a crypto winner, but had some help with inheritance. Worked through college and left debt free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;2012&lt;/strong&gt; graduated state school, with a finance degree, couldnt find work so went into sales $55k /yr and company car /w 18% 401k matching. Lived like a poor college kid and maxed out retirement funds. Biggest regret was not piling into ROTH IRA since I qualified. Received $45k inheritance from fathers estate.** Net worth @ $104k Age 25**,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;2013&lt;/strong&gt; Left first job, started new job at another sales company but took a pay cut. $45k /yr plus uncapped commissions. Ended up getting paid like $65,000 total comp. The company was horrible but basically they provided great training for my next gig. I lasted 11 months there. I lost all my 401k matching at the time due to leaving before 2-year vesting. Lived at home during this time to save on rent since I was traveling so much.** Net worth @ $168k Age 26 $25k annual spendin**g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013-2016&lt;/strong&gt; Got a new job when I still had that old job and basically jumped my base to $80k /yr. The big take away is the higher the sales role, the bigger the base. The bonus ranged from $0- $60k at the time. I also discovered FIRE around this time. I moved out when I landed the job and lived poor for the next few years and bought used furniture and stuff. I bought a shit condo but in a well managed complex for $33k. The place was nasty but after $12k of fixing it up, it felt nice and it was home for 2 years. I did the work myself for the most part and saved cash, I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t do it again since it wouldn&amp;#39;t have costed much more had professionals done it. It has since appreciated to $65k. After making good bonuses at this role ranging from $40k-$65k and consistent 3-4% raises, I decided it was time to buy a bigger home in a fun part of town. My typical take home was around $130-$165k these years and market returns were GREAT. &lt;strong&gt;Net worth @ $522k age 29 $21-$25k annual spending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016-2018&lt;/strong&gt; My parents wanted to give me a gift when they heard I wanted to buy a bigger home. So I was very fortunate to receive from them a $30k as a down payment for a $315k home. I rented out my old condo for $860/mo and net around $5k a year in net income. I rent out a furnished bedroom in my new home for $900/mo with 6 month leases. Appreciation in the home was minimal, $15k so far. In addition, I got promoted at work and went from my prior role&amp;#39;s salary of $89k to around $103k with the same bonus structure. The last years bonus was $0 and I was disappointed however, I am still grinding away to hopefully see the same kind of bonus from prior years. However, total take home pay even in a no bonus year is around $115k due to 401k matching, small cash payouts, stock purchase program, condo rental income. &lt;strong&gt;Net worth @ 810k Age 30/31 $40k annual spending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018-2019&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t like to count my chickens before they hatch but I would probably suspect that my ending NW in 2019 would be shy of $1M. I believe I can put away $25k the remainder of this year and another $90k next year. If the market does 7-8% return I&amp;#39;d be happy. &lt;strong&gt;????Net worth @ $990k Age 32??????&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE &amp;quot;day dreaming&amp;quot; as a method of coping with stress and anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt; I read a prior post on this sub about how the OP used FIRE as a way to escape the stress and anxiety from his work. After reading that, I completely knew what he was talking about. Whenever I get stressed or anxious, I day dream about FIRE and it helps. Daydreaming isn&amp;#39;t healthy for me and I sought professional help. After visiting a psychiatrist, I was prescribed several meds that have made me feel really good about what I do and have reduced the stress and anxiety down to a minimum. Therefore, I believe I will work well into my 40s or 50s. I had originally wanted to quit at 35-38 years old. But I realize, I&amp;#39;m really good at talking to people and sales in general. So why waste my talents, unless I find something else I&amp;#39;d rather do.&lt;/p&gt;

I just received an email from Personal Capital today highlighting the ""Significant Improvements to Your Retirement Planner"". Here is the link to the video describing the changes (https://vimeo.com/281519928) and I've posted the email text at the bottom of the post.

Previously, I was underwhelmed with the lack of variables available when creating your retirement plan and ended up turning to the numerous other tools out there (FIREcalc, cFIREsim, i-ORP) for crafting my plan. It looks like they've taken notice of those tools and incorporated a lot of the functionality. I haven't had the chance to give it a test drive, but hopefully this will help me stop bouncing around between tools as I develop and track my plan.

 ""We’re excited to let you know about a series of improvements we’ve recently made to our Retirement Planner tool. Our goal is to constantly improve the sophistication of our tools to ensure you have the most up-to-date, precise, and holistic view of your financial life. The new improvements include:

* You can now view the breakdown and growth of your portfolio by asset location: Taxable, Tax-Deferred, Tax-Free, and Education
* During retirement, your cash flows are now personalized to your specific circumstances based on your tax filing status, state, and annual income events
* Retirement spending assumes a decrease of 1% per year, in line with what we have observed for most retirees
* Adjustment to return assumptions to reflect the impact of current interest rates, investor behavior and transaction costs
* Lower inflation estimates to reflect current market conditions
* Option to enter income events as before or after taxes
* Ability to toggle inflation assumptions for certain income cash flows such as annuities or pensions, which typically do not come with a cost of living adjustment
* When spouses retire in different years, we will consider full retirement to be the year when both spouses are retired. During the period when only one spouse is retired, savings will be adjusted downward by the retired spouse’s salary.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time poster here, hoping to share some potential good news with the community that has given me so much guidance and direction (as I lurked in the shadows).&lt;/p&gt;

I've got about 5k in my savings account.

I inherited roughly 420k from my father a few years back, and it's grown 160k since in mutual funds.

At age 32, I'll have a zero taxed 100k annuity check mailed to me from a lawsuit involving my grandmothers wrongful death due to improper care at a hospital. Further adding to my net worth. According to my grandmothers partner, I will be left another 100k at their passing. These things will further increase my net worth by  200k, presumably. Being that these things are not here yet, and one of them is not even a guarantee, as things happen, I choose not to rely on them for obvious reasons, but these are simply the facts. (not including the fact that I have no desire for this person to die, they are 80 and still kicking, and I am happy for it).

I'm 24. I live in a relatively cheap area of the country. I have no idea what I want to do with life, and I'm regretting not taking  enough action.

But it's hard to take action when you have no idea what you'd even like. I've considered web development as a free lancer, so that I can travel and pay expenses. I also wanted to fly, but I recently was involved in a crash landing that has me a little sketched at the moment. I play guitar and I frequently lift, and stay healthy and fit.

I hate the idea of a ""career"" career...even as a pilot, or a personal trainer, or dietitian, or musician or someone that has to adhere to a schedule, or others. I'm not saying that's even an option. I guess every one is a slave to something..haha. But working entry level jobs to pay my bills off is also a bore. My car is paid off, and my bills are easily paid monthly with my job, but not much room for saving and stashing away a lot into investments.

I almost feel as if I'd love starting something like a blog, or a drop shipping business, or to freelance code, or be able to travel the world and do work involving fitness, music, etc but I can't even begin to wrap my mind around how people even network in such a way to accomplish all that. Maybe someone has been in this situation before beginning with the career field they're involved in now that helped you reach financial independence quickly? I'm just looking for personal experiences, either for some inspiration, or to get the cogs in my head turning, I suppose.

I guess I'm wondering if there are any career paths involving freelance work or side hustles that anyone has ventured down that eventually led you to financial independence (preferably ones that don't involve me answering to ""the man"", sorry if that sounds self-righteous, but I can't stand answering to a boss), and if they'd not mind sharing how they got into it..and what they like about it, the pros and cons, etc? I'd like to eventually be entirely financially independent...but it's complicated to think about a house (if I build, I'd build very small, like a micro home), family, or anything of the like when I don't even have a fixed direction that I'd like to take my life in.

Any advice?...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;99.999% percent of my money is invested. I&amp;#39;ve got about 5k in my savings account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I inherited roughly 420k from my father a few years back, and it&amp;#39;s grown 160k since in mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 32, I&amp;#39;ll have a zero taxed 100k annuity check mailed to me from a lawsuit involving my grandmothers wrongful death due to improper care at a hospital. Further adding to my net worth. According to my grandmothers partner, I will be left another 100k at their passing. These things will further increase my net worth by  200k, presumably. Being that these things are not here yet, and one of them is not even a guarantee, as things happen, I choose not to rely on them for obvious reasons, but these are simply the facts. (not including the fact that I have no desire for this person to die, they are 80 and still kicking, and I am happy for it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 24. I live in a relatively cheap area of the country. I have no idea what I want to do with life, and I&amp;#39;m regretting not taking  enough action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s hard to take action when you have no idea what you&amp;#39;d even like. I&amp;#39;ve considered web development as a free lancer, so that I can travel and pay expenses. I also wanted to fly, but I recently was involved in a crash landing that has me a little sketched at the moment. I play guitar and I frequently lift, and stay healthy and fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the idea of a &amp;quot;career&amp;quot; career...even as a pilot, or a personal trainer, or dietitian, or musician or someone that has to adhere to a schedule, or others. I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s even an option. I guess every one is a slave to something..haha. But working entry level jobs to pay my bills off is also a bore. My car is paid off, and my bills are easily paid monthly with my job, but not much room for saving and stashing away a lot into investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost feel as if I&amp;#39;d love starting something like a blog, or a drop shipping business, or to freelance code, or be able to travel the world and do work involving fitness, music, etc but I can&amp;#39;t even begin to wrap my mind around how people even network in such a way to accomplish all that. Maybe someone has been in this situation before beginning with the career field they&amp;#39;re involved in now that helped you reach financial independence quickly? I&amp;#39;m just looking for personal experiences, either for some inspiration, or to get the cogs in my head turning, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m wondering if there are any career paths involving freelance work or side hustles that anyone has ventured down that eventually led you to financial independence (preferably ones that don&amp;#39;t involve me answering to &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot;, sorry if that sounds self-righteous, but I can&amp;#39;t stand answering to a boss), and if they&amp;#39;d not mind sharing how they got into it..and what they like about it, the pros and cons, etc? I&amp;#39;d like to eventually be entirely financially independent...but it&amp;#39;s complicated to think about a house (if I build, I&amp;#39;d build very small, like a micro home), family, or anything of the like when I don&amp;#39;t even have a fixed direction that I&amp;#39;d like to take my life in.&lt;/p&gt;

I grew up in a low-income household in the south. I spent a few years in a single parent home. I remember sharing a bunk bed with my younger sibling in a 700 sq foot apartment. I remember constantly worrying about money.

I still worry about money. A recent post talked about anxiety with money, and it described me perfectly. I still look at prices before ordering food at a restaurant. I still work multiple jobs to increase my income. Although I struggle with anxiety, I hope my story can provide some inspiration.

I read my first personal finance book at age 10, Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I knew two things: I was poor and didn't want to stay that way.

I married my wife several years ago right out of college. I attended college at a location where I could graduate with minimal debt. We graduated with about 20K in student loans. We lived with my parents and paid off our loans in a few months. In 2013, we were making 75K combined between both of us. We bought a conservative house based on our income (Cost of 189K). One of my only regrets is not buying a bigger house in 2013. (I was convinced we were about to have another recession.)

In the past five years, I went from a -20K net worth to 200K. We had two kids during this time, and my wife stays home with our children now. I know most posts on this sub display the extremes of people trying to reach FI ASAP. I know having children early in life is not an ideal financial decision. I know I am losing income by having my wife stay home. However, I still built a sizeable war chest with these factors.

My current net worth is 160K in investments and 40K of home equity. I only have 50K in my 401(k), the rest are in a brokerage account or in Roth IRA's. I know this is not the typical path, but I think most people of the FI community focus too much on ""saving money on taxes."" My effective tax rate was below 10% for most of my career so far. I'd rather have 90K of money I'd already paid taxes on than 100K of money in a 401(k).

I have been promoted multiple times at work. I work for a large company with great potential. I also live in a LCOL area with a 20 minute commute. I work as a freelancer on the side in addition to my day job. Since 2013, I have increased my income from 40K to 95K. I am in line to get another promotion in the next year or so which will increase my income to 110K. I do not plan to enhance my lifestyle once I get another promotion. Working at a growing company is an excellent way to boost a career. Much easier to get promoted when your company is making money.

My plan is to quit corporate life once I hit 500K or 600k. My projections currently have this point around the age of 33 - 35 depending on the input rate of return. I want to continue working on my own accord at that point. Maybe some freelancing, maybe some Barista FIRE. I just don't want to sit in a cubicle my whole life.

I know this is not the most exciting story to read, but I am happy to answer any questions. I also know 200K at 27 is not the most impressive number on this sub. However, if I can make it to this point at this age, anybody can with enough forward planning. Happy to answer any questions.

I want to continue working on my own accord at that point. Maybe some freelancing, maybe some Barista FIRE. I just don&amp;#39;t want to sit in a cubicle my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is not the most exciting story to read, but I am happy to answer any questions. I also know 200K at 27 is not the most impressive number on this sub. However, if I can make it to this point at this age, anybody can with enough forward planning. Happy to answer any questions. I don&amp;#39;t live on my phone, so there may be a few hour delay in my responses. &lt;/p&gt;

Based in Australia, NW is in AUD. 

**Current financial situation**

Me, age 24

- Salary: $120k + superannuation

Wife, age 23

- Salary: Just started her own business, earned ~$30k the first two months of operating, minus ~$6k expenses. She was probably making an average of ~$50-60k or so a year at a job prior to this. *We won't immediately reap the benefits of an increased income as she'll likely maintain the same salary and continue investing into the business.

--

- We own an apartment together. Bought for $470k, probably worth that or a bit less now

- Equity ~$270k ($135k cash/offsetting the loan and $135k in the actual property) - so mortgage is under $200k at 4%

- One car between us, paid off, worth about ~$27k

- Probably $50k or so in superannuation between us (I guess this is similar to 401k)

- Savings rate is around 55% the last six months (this has come up from 35% as we've tightened up and started focusing on saving more after getting the engagement / travel / wedding / car / fitting out apartment 

- So excluding the car, current NW is around $320k

- If we stay at the same income (hopefully this increases) and savings rate, we'll be worth $1M at 37. 

--

No tricks here, we've just worked hard and saved. 

--

We're in the accumulation phase right now. Very low risk, we're just sitting on our property, and paying that down. No money in shares / no money really working for us - it's all offsetting the loan. It’s been hard to justify putting money into shares when we get a guaranteed 4% return paying our mortgage off

No plans to have kids for at least another 4-5 years. We've worked our arses off up until now, and I don't want to be complacent and not take opportunities to rapidly increase our NW. 

But I, in particular, am getting itchy. I want to grow our NW and we are young and can afford to take some risk. 

**Question:**

What would you do in our position? 

- We've considered moving into commercial property, but due to value appreciation, the returns on commercial leases aren't as good as when we looked a couple of years ago. 

- We've considered selling the apartment and buying a small (2-3 bedroom) house for ~$850k - we aren't buying anything fancy at this price point, it's what property is worth here. Sitting on that for a few years and then either extending it (~$100-250k more), or selling it and buying a bigger house. There's the obvious opportunity cost of holding on to an apartment that isn't appreciating vs buying into a strong house market, plus this would be our ‘family home’.

- We could look into buying residential property further out in strong employment locations. Cheaper houses, rent out the property, and be able to hold our apartment. This seems feasible besides running into renters that trash the house. 

- Is there more to this than the wife increasing her business income and me increasing my income? I plan to hit $200k income by the time I'm 30, and we have plans to scale her business well beyond what she was earning in her job. For the most part every pay raise never feels like enough, when we force a hards avings rate it feels like we’re sacrificing our lifestyle and it resets every month. Maybe I’m trying to sprint a marathon...

I always put internal pressure on myself to keep moving and growing, and it just feels like we're complacent and too comfortable right now. We aren't working this hard to have a (no disrespect) unimpressive NW at 30.

No kids yet. Work in IT, can, but dont want to work fully remote yet. NOT a developer so not a 6 figure salary yet. Time in life to make the next step in buying a house and laying the foundations for a family but ... got sticker shock. 

I understand what some people here say about COL. I lived in Los Angeles prior, loved the outdoors and culture but price to pay was just so friggin ridiculously high. 

I was going to list my criteria of what's important to me, but as an immigrant to this great country -  it is my prerogative to adjust and fit so I can make the very best of it. I WANT to adjust. 

All I ask are places that have a good mix of jobs availability/growth, nature, and connectivity (airports or transportation hubs). I'm not looking at the lowest cost. The special sauce that I'm hoping for is ... I don't know how to articulate this very well ... a working class ethos and neighborliness? Quality of life stuff. 

For those who have searched and found, or are still searching - can you tell me whats your list? These are mine, and they're just observations. 

1. Atlanta. Not great in any but well rounded in everything. Scores high in connectivity, affordability, above average in growing jobs. Diverse, nice folks and some nature. Kind of becoming the LA of the South I feel. 

2. Denver. Very awesome on nature, good on jobs. Nature types like me want to be here but wondering if its going to be the next Seattle. But, the midwest ethos (or just Colorado) is the pulling factor here.

3. Seattle area. Jobs. Nature. Alaska airlines. Very high cost of living. But the salaries here (and no state income tax) do offset a lot of the burdens. It may be too late now because a stupid house is like 500k. Also, bigfoot. 

4. Texas. No state income tax, lots of land to have live in a castle by myself, great connectivity, great diversity but not sure about neighborliness. Except for Austin, it may almost be depressing in the nature category. 

5. Salt Lake City. Almost moved here. Superb nature. Just OK connectivity. Low-ish cost, but the salaries don't seem to be competitive. Dual track of life here, Mormons, and everyone else (the minority).

6. Charlotte/Raleigh. A *safe* balance of things but honestly nothing to shout about. Something like Atlanta lite with slightly cooler summers. 

7. Chicago/Minneapolis. I have not been here so I apologize if I lumped them together. That said, is this the midwest ethos capital that also fulfills the jobs and nature criteria? 

8. **BONUS**: If I could work remote and didn't want to settle down (maybe like some kinda of super cool uncle) I would consider these places to be strategic. 

8a. Las Vegas: Close to California, 5 National Parks, excellent connectivity (direct international flights) cheap when living off the strip, seriously good asian food, people want to visit you. 

8b. Orlando. No state income tax Florida, really great looking housing that is on the cusp of reasonable affordability. Space coast, Disneyworld means superb connectivity.

· Limiting entertainment budget and keeping myself busy reading free blogs online/library use, visiting friends and doing pot luck , volunteering and dog transports when I have a weekend off.

· I consistently look for the cheapest gas around and hyper mileage to work. 

· I have eliminated a budget for clothes unless it is something that I need for work (I still need to look presentable and keep it professional)

· I am moving out of my beautiful rental apartment into a smaller apartment with a roommate at the end of the month. My current rent is $1,500 (not including utilities) and my rent expense at the new place will be $650 for a room (including everything).

I feel like I don’t see as many CPAs representing this subreddit as I should!

I originally chose to go into accounting because of the job stability and different career paths (audit, taxes, corporate accounting, etc). As a naturally financially conscious person, I worked full time out of high school while I went to community college and lived with relatives for a few years, with the goal of saving up money to graduate debt-free. After 3 years I transferred to a university, and after 3 more years and a lot of hard work, I finished up with my master’s degree in 2016 and started working for one of the Big 4 financial firms with just a little bit of debt. I honestly still had a blast during my college years despite making sacrifices and putting in the work that I did. Anyone trying to not be swallowed in debt by college tuition should consider community college, it’s a game changer.

Anybody who has worked for one of the Big 4 financial firms knows that it’s a stressful and high-paced environment. The long hours and job demands burn people out pretty quickly. I’m in a LCOL area and the Big 4 firms around here hire in new graduates with a master’s degree (or equivalent) at ~57k a year. Even with decent pay right out of college (but still less than the tech folks) it still doesn’t feel like enough for the hours that we put in and the soul draining work that we do, with the trade off being great exit opportunities.

About 6 months into working at my company, I knew I wanted something more than working my life away and started following the r/FI community. While living frugally over the last 2 years of working, I’ve managed to go from a NW of roughly -3k to 60k. I’m not even close to FIRE at this point, but even having the amount that I do (three times my expenses, Single with no kids) makes work so much less stressful. If I were to get fired what’s the worst that could happen? I take a break for a few months and move into a higher-paying job.

I just want to say thanks to all of you for making my life so much less stressful. Having the freedom to leave my job that if I want and not worry about anything makes work so much easier. Even though I’ll only have ~95k saved up by this time next year, I plan on leaving my company and moving to Thailand. I’ve been there a few times over the years and can’t get over how amazing of a place it is. I plan on working part-time remote jobs as a contractor, and working maybe 4 months out of each year doing accounting work during the busy winter months. Even though I’ll be giving up a great job in exchange for one where I don’t save nearly as much, I want to live my life doing something enjoyable. Being on the FI path for the last couple of years has given me that option.

Has anyone else made a move abroad during their young years? How did it work out for you? If you have any advice (or critiques) for my situation, I’d love to hear it. Also if anyone has any questions about the CPA route to a well-paying job, I’d be happy to answer!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;25 year-old CPA here working for one of the Big 4 financial firms.

&lt;p&gt;About 6 months into working at my company, I knew I wanted something more than working my life away and started following the &lt;a href=""/r/FI""&gt;r/FI&lt;/a&gt; community. While living frugally over the last 2 years of working, I’ve managed to go from a NW of roughly -3k to 60k. I’m not even close to FIRE at this point, but even having the amount that I do (three times my expenses, Single with no kids) makes work so much less stressful. If I were to get fired what’s the worst that could happen? I take a break for a few months and move into a higher-paying job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to say thanks to all of you for making my life so much less stressful. Having the freedom to leave my job that if I want and not worry about anything makes work so much easier. Even though I’ll only have ~95k saved up by this time next year, I plan on leaving my company and moving to Thailand. I’ve been there a few times over the years and can’t get over how amazing of a place it is. I plan on working part-time remote jobs as a contractor, and working maybe 4 months out of each year doing accounting work during the busy winter months. Even though I’ll be giving up a great job in exchange for one where I don’t save nearly as much, I want to live my life doing something enjoyable. Being on the FI path for the last couple of years has given me that option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else made a move abroad during their young years? How did it work out for you? If you have any advice (or critiques) for my situation, I’d love to hear it. Also if anyone has any questions about the CPA route to a well-paying job, I’d be happy to answer!&lt;/p&gt;

I've had the role I am switching to before and I could not be happier. But quite surprisingly, even within a few days of making this decisions I have noticed a change in my attitude towards FIRE. I am caring less and less about when it will happen. My high base level stress is what was fueling my constant need to plan FIRE even when I wasn't aware that there was anything bothering me. In hindsight, this should be really obvious... when work isn't miserable, dreaming about not doing it is not something we obsessively gravitate towards. But in the midst of it I did not see it so clearly.

The rest of this post is about what I mean by stress since it is a vague concept. In order to make this decision I deliberated for a year over what exactly is it that is making me miserable. I tried anything I could think of to quantify my sources of stress and reduce them as much as possible. For me, stress came from the following elements:

*  Complexity of work: This is by far the biggest factor. The more complex the work, the more anxiety inducing it becomes and the more effort it takes to make any progress. Regardless of any other variables, a complex enough job can substantially reduce my QOL. There was no getting around that in my role.
* Quantity of work: There is a certain threshold of work, mental and physical, above which it starts to take a toll on us. If that threshold is being consistently crossed, it can generate a lot of stress and unhappiness.
* Urgency of work: While urgency can be a powerful tool for productivity, it also generates it's own form of stress. Consistent exposure to it will generate similar effects as too much quantity.
* Alignment with personal goals: A job that feels like it is contributing towards what you want to learn and accomplish in life, suddenly becomes a lot more bearable. That's how professors can get students to do the nastiest work for minimum wage. A job that is completely at odds with your personal goals can become a potent source of stress, even in the absence of all other variables.

My job was a intense combination of all the above. To compensate for it, it offered unparalleled benefits and autonomy, but none of it made up for the fact that in the end I was slowly becoming a husk of my former self waiting to start living my life. Even worse, over the years I was starting to forget how freeing and enjoyable life can be when not burdened by the ever present stress that drains your life force. Absent other sources of accomplishment and pride, I was starting to replace my identity with my professional title. I knew then that if I didn't take action now, it would be a one way journey to the tragic life of a workaholic. 

Anyways, the point of this post is to make others in a similar boat think about why they are here. If some form of stress/job dissatisfaction is the reason you are here, you owe it to yourself to try to find a solution now instead of wait decades for retirement and watch your best years pass by.

**Family:** Married with young child. Considering having a second within a year

**Income:** Net household income (after taxes) 

2017: $200k

2016: $180k

2015: $120k

SO's job is in the public sector currently at $50k increasing incrementally ever year and topping at around $90k at the end of the career (10 years later). Mine varies because my earnings are bonus based. I cannot rely on the fact that I will still be making this kind of money every year long term wise. 

**Expenses:** As the years progressed, I've been able to increase my savings rate. Expenses have remained relatively consistent despite increased income. They range from $60-$75k. I expect this to increase as kids get older and if we add a new addition to the family

**Net Worth:** 

Currently sitting at $660k. 

Net Investable Assets: $423k

**Asset Allocation:**

Condo: $400k

Car: $20k

Cash: $180k

Retirement Savings Account: $108k (in mutual funds)

Tax Free Savings: $110k

Other Non-Registered Investments: $25k

Mortgage Remaining: $183k

**Challenges**

* We have outgrown our condo and are looking to upsize to a larger space. We really want to stay in our area but it is very expensive. Our options now are to purchase a townhouse (ranges from $900-$1M or a semi-detached home ($1.1-$1.3M). The other option is to purchase a ""forever home"" which would be a detached place (minimum $1.4M++). We like the idea of a semi or fully detached because we can rent out the basement. Our area is in high demand for rentals. We would also try and keep our condo and rent it out as well.
*  have a large cash position for downpayment on our next home
* Addition of a second child will obviously add expenses through the next 2 decades. Reducing savings rate.
* SO's job is steady. Mine is relatively stable but income levels can vary. Economy is good now so I expect this year and next to be similar to 2017. However it can turn on a dime and my income can be significantly reduced. I don't want to calculate my timeline with my all time high income

**Path to success?**

Looking for advice on how I can accelerate my FIRE timeline

* From a FIRE standpoint, I'm undecided on how to handle the housing situation. Buying a forever home at $1.4M means a huge mortgage payment so no more savings.
* I've been contemplating if acquiring more condo properties for rental can help accelerate my FIRE goals
* Given our investable assets worth $423k now, we are a long way from our $2.4M figure. I essentially need another $2M worth to achieve FI, but just a quick calculation means it will take me a whole working lifetime to get there. I'd really want to be able to RE. My job has long hours and is high stress.
* My current car is 15 years old and is on its way out. I've budgeted $20k to buy a used car
* Any better way to keep my large cash holding if I need to be ready to use it within a year for the second home downpayment?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been a reader of the sub for quite some time and have learned a lot from it.

&lt;li&gt;Addition of a second child will obviously add expenses through the next 2 decades. Reducing savings rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SO&amp;#39;s job is steady. Mine is relatively stable but income levels can vary. Economy is good now so I expect this year and next to be similar to 2017. However it can turn on a dime and my income can be significantly reduced. I don&amp;#39;t want to calculate my timeline with my all time high income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path to success?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for advice on how I can accelerate my FIRE timeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a FIRE standpoint, I&amp;#39;m undecided on how to handle the housing situation. Buying a forever home at $1.4M means a huge mortgage payment so no more savings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been contemplating if acquiring more condo properties for rental can help accelerate my FIRE goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given our investable assets worth $423k now, we are a long way from our $2.4M figure. I essentially need another $2M worth to achieve FI, but just a quick calculation means it will take me a whole working lifetime to get there. I&amp;#39;d really want to be able to RE. My job has long hours and is high stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My current car is 15 years old and is on its way out. I&amp;#39;ve budgeted $20k to buy a used car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any better way to keep my large cash holding if I need to be ready to use it within a year for the second home downpayment?&lt;/li&gt;

The scenario is basically this: We're right before the next crash and you're somewhere in the middle of your FIRE accumulation phase. From that pre-crash valuation perspective you might look at a portfolio of say 1MM and ask yourself, what happens if the market crashes by 40%?

My takeaway from this experiment is that especially within the accumulation phase people should not be too worried about the next crisis in regards of reaching their FIRE number.
A market crash is still not great, obviously a continued bull market is better, but it is less worse than you'd expect looking at it through the right lense. The effect of a potential higher SWR and DCA with lower prices help navigate through the effect of lower absolute principal. In the experiments the overall drop in portfolio value was basically not happening or much less than looking at the ""absolute numbers"".

She just quit her job (I've been FIRE) so we're now living off of investment income.
* We plan to spend up to $40,000 per year in FIRE, though some passive income (for now) means we'll draw less than that from our investments (30k-ish).
* We plan to use the Roth IRA rollover ladder for future expenses.
* Our taxable accounts are substantial (over 400k) so we won't need to pull funds from our Roth IRAs any time soon.

The dilemma I'm having is how much money to rollover from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA for income purposes. We live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid. We're a household of 3 so our income needs to be at least $20,420 in 2018 to not be on Medicaid. Our income won't be any higher than $30,629 because this keeps us in the highest Cost Sharing Reduction group.

For every dollar between $20,420 and $27,158 (133% FPL for 3 people) we'll pay a constant 7.5% in tax (state tax &amp; increased insurance premiums, still no Federal tax due to standard deduction and qualified dividends being taxed @ long term capital gains rate of 0%).

From $27,158 (133% FPL) to $28,179 (138% FPL), that $1,021 increase in income will cost us $443 (state tax &amp; insurance premiums, still no Federal tax), an effective tax rate of over 43%.

From $28,179 (138% FPL) to $30,630 (150% FPL), that $2,451 increase in income will cost us $428 (state tax &amp; insurance premiums, just reaching the end of our qualified dividend income so Federal tax is still basically $0), an effective tax rate of 17.5%.

The state tax is a constant 5.5% in this equation. The big driver of cost increases is the rise in the percentage of income we pay for insurance premiums as we move into higher income brackets. What I've been trying to figure out is how I balance what is worth paying in ""tax"" now against what we'll eventually need to withdraw from our Roth IRAs.

This isn't a long-term strategy because no matter what income we choose it may not be enough to fully fund living off of Roth IRA contributions. We'd be rolling over about 20k a year and eventually we'll likely need to withdraw about 30k a year, assuming we spend the full 40k a year we plan for. However, our base spending is only 30k a year so there's room for less elective spending. It's hard to say how soon we'll need to touch our Roth IRAs because of how large our taxable accounts are. It might be almost 20 years before we'll need to touch them, or it could be 8-10 years if we see a big recession. I'm not focused on the future beyond the next couple years too much because there are a lot of things that could change the equation. If we keep our rental, the mortgage will be gone in 10 years so we'll see another 10k a year in income. If we have a child it would raise the threshold for the same FPL levels to an acceptable dollar amount, making this concern moot.

If we choose to declare a higher income, we're locking in that higher tax rate because we're paying it now, whereas something could change in the future where we would pay less tax. The ACA could change or go away. We could move to a state with no income tax, changing what we'd pay in future tax. We've talked about international travel so if we were out of the country for a year that might present a one time low/no tax opportunity to move some money around.

What ""tax rate"" do other FIREd folks use as a threshold where it's worth paying for the income? Do you always try to get as close to zero as possible or do you have a number where you say, anything that keeps me under X% is worth taking now?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

I am an immigrant and I immigrated here when I was a teen with my parents and sister. We lived in a LCOL area and my parents' combined income never exceeded $45k. However, they still managed to buy a house, everyone had a car, and we lived pretty comfortably. However, there was no room for savings. We come from a country where saving money is less realistic than seeing a unicorn, so income in always equaled spending. Fast forward to 2010 at the height of the recession and both of my parents lost their jobs (I was in college at the time). The difficult times we went through during that time as well as discovering this subreddit right after graduating from college would define how I look at money and would lead me to where I am today.

Sometime early in life I realized that academic success was my way out of the poverty cycle. My parents were incredibly supportive and gave me every opportunity to succeed. In high school I worked 35-45 hrs/week while also managing to graduate as valedictorian. I got into a top 3 school in the country and graduated in 2012 with a degree in engineering. 

I got my first job starting at $55k/year in NYC. After taxes, health insurance, etc. my take home pay was around $2800. My rent was $1100, transit was $150, and food in NYC is expensive. I quickly realized that although I was making more money at 23 than both my parents combined had ever made, without some cutbacks I would live paycheck to paycheck and never get anywhere. Around this time I also discovered /r/PF and everything changed. 

I am not a spender by nature and I am not into fancy clothes, shoes, purses, electronics, etc. I like good food, I like going out, and I like live music and sports. So I spend money on these things. I don't really have a budget and I don't know my savings rate. I just know that whenever I buy something, I make sure I really need it and I try to get the best deal possible. I try not to spend money on frivolous things (lunch, coffee, $15 cocktails, expensive purses and clothes). I save a lot of money on rent by underspending - yes it's possible even in NYC. I live with my boyfriend and even though our combined income would have allowed us to move into a $3000 apartment at the time, we found one for $1700 just outside of NYC and lived there for 5 years, even though our incomes had almost doubled in that time span. By the time we moved out, my share of the rent was only 12% of my salary ($880 on a $94k/yr salary). My salary kept increasing from year to year, while I tried to keep my expenses steady (I did suffer from some lifestyle inflation, but not nearly enough to match the increases in my income).

My salaries went from:

2012 - $55k

2013 - $58k

2014 - $62k

2015 - $66k

2016 - $74k

2017 - $86k

2018 - $94k

Savings:

* I have been maxing out my 401k for the last 3 years. Before that I had never put aside less than $10k/year. I get a 10% match from my employer which has added anywhere from $5k to $10k year.
* I save all my profit shares. They go straight into my Vanguard or my IRA
* I max out my Roth IRA every year
* I get paid once a month so whatever is left over in my bank account at the end of the month goes straight to savings. That means it was extra money that I didn't need. Over the years this amount has changed drastically. Some months it would be $300-400. Recently, as my salary has gone up, this amount could be $3k. If, for example, it's February and it's frigid and we don't do much socializing, my expenses come down to rent, groceries, take our a few times a months, and that's it. Sometimes this is less than $1600/month, which means that the rest of my salary is extra. This goes straight to Vanguard.

[My asset allocation](https://imgur.com/Z36E4IE)

Not shown are the almost $30k I've paid off on my parents' apartment. This apartment is in my name due to their credit issues, and will be mine to keep when they are gone. However, they pay it off. I know rule #1 on this sub is to not do this for family, but my parents are literally the only reason why I am where I am and I owe everything to them. I have paid off $30k and there is $30k left on the mortgage. I plan on paying it off and ""gifting"" it to them when I'm done, thus liberating them from the mortgage. I've thrown any excess money there (so any bonuses, any money left over at the end of the month) has gone there which is why my Vanguard and is low compared to 401k. They don't know I'm doing this for them and would/will kill me when they found out, but I can't wait to surprise them :) Technically the apartment is in my name so it's part of my net worth but it won't be mine to sell for hopefully a very long time, and I hope to be FIRE long before that, so I don't count it as part of my FIRE goals. My parents also signed over our house in my home country to me and that's worth around $120k. However, it's also excluded because I would never sell it due to sentimental value. 

I am 28, will be 29 in a couple of months. My goal was $300k by the time I'm 30 and I think it's doable. Overall, I know I'm extremely lucky - lucky to have a supportive family to allow me to build a career that pays me very well that allows me to have a high savings rate. My goal is to become a millionaire by the time I'm 35. I don't know how realistic this is but I don't plan on changing anything in the meantime. I will continue to go to concerts, to sporting events, I will continue to eat out a couple of times a week, I will continue traveling a couple of times a year, and I will continue not spending money on stupid stuff. My salary will continue to grow while my spending will remain steady. My net worth will continue to climb at a steady pace, and I look forward to just watching that number grow. I'm not tied to any deadlines or any expectations. I just want to take advantage of the fortunate situation I'm in and I want to give myself the flexibility that has alluded a lot of people. 

Feel free to ask me any questions :) I just wanted to share my story since I never dreamt that I would have this much money in my life and it's an incredible feeling knowing that not only am I financially stable, but I am able to help out the people that helped me get to that point.

So we can make fun of them for their primitive notions of finance. Just kidding, seems like most of them believe in careful spending, at least in theory. 

All except this one: ""The best — try to seize the moment and buy what you really want in the moment, I mean, yes you plan for the future, but don't overthink it....They [my parents] probably encouraged me to save money but I never did, yeah I've never been able to do it.""

Our goal is $2 million with a 5% withdrawal rate.

We lived very close to work, but in an undesirable area.  Because of that, we owned a second home about 2.5 hours away that we would go to most weekends and holidays.  This second home is much closer to friends and family.  This is where we planned on retiring to once we hit our magic number.

Our company started offering remote work to some employees who were in certain positions.  Unfortunately, nether of our positions were available.  We spoke to our managers and we were both offered remote work by moving into different positions within the company.  Our combined income would drop $50k, bringing us down to $170k.

Well, we pulled the trigger.  We sold our primary home (walked away with $62k at settlement), and moved into our second home, where we now both work remotely.  Our expenditures dropped almost $2000/mo (no more mortgage, insurance, property taxes, utilities, and weekly gas driving back and forth to our second house).  We also cut back on eating out for dinner (which we were doing a lot on weekends while at the second house).  We cook at home much more now.

Our income obviously dropped more than our expenditures, but our quality of life is so much better.  On top of all that, we had our first child.  Because we both work from home, we have no day care expenses, which we would have had if we both still worked in the office.

Were we stupid for giving up that much income to simplify our lives?  I don't want to really do the math to see how many years it will set us back.

My friends told me that the pension cut be cut drastically and getting Social Security in the future is a wild card.

They asked what do you think would have happened if the economic crash of 2008 would not have been stopped by a massive influx of government spending.  Maybe a 1930s style depression.  Would Trump and the crazy Congress be as open to bailing out the economy as last time?  Doubtful.  Social Security and pensions would be cut deeply in a 1930s type depression.

So, no, I am not truly financially independent if I depend on a pension and Social Security for a significant part of my income stream, they say.  Your thoughts?

(ADDED ONE DAY LATER: After much thought and further discussion with my friends I have decided that basically the only truly financially secure people who are not working have liquid assets to cover 50 years, with enough to cover at least 8% annual inflation each year.  The money is either in a number of banks and/or in cash somewhere.  Even this is only 99% secure because a war or economic crash could make our banks and currency worthless.

The traditional view of being financially independent for the next 30-50 years (Social Security-pension-annuity and enough in investment accounts to cover someone's needs for 30-50 years with a 4% withdrawal of one's savings and investment accounts and an expectation of 3% inflation going forward), is maybe 70% secure, in my opinion.  We live in an ever increasing crazy world, who knows what will happen!)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I start getting Social Security and a pension to subsidize my annual withdrawals from my 401K and IRA in a few months I can leave the long nightmare of full time work.

I have the unique opportunity to become a detective at a local county prosecutor's office. Police academy, gun and badge, the whole thing.

I've always been super interested in law enforcement, especially investigations, and this opening is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If I took the job, I know I would love it and do well at it. 

That being said, my current income allows me to keep plugging away for another five years or so, become FI or close to it, and move to a western state which more closely matches my lifestyle (outdoors, active, not a NY mentality).

-10 years to vest
-  1.67% per year for first 19 years.  Then jumps to 35% total at 20 years and 2% per year thereafter.  
- I contribute 6% of pay into plan
- option to buy 3 years of service, due to military experience, after 5 years.  Would cost 6% per year bought. 
- collect pension at age 63

DC Plan
- 1 year to vest
- I still contribute 6%, but state adds 8% (goes to 10% after 10 years) as well
- still waiting to see investment options, but looks to be similar to typical 401k type funds.  

I have run some excel calculations and even assuming I collect 35 years of pension the DC plan is better unless rate of return averages less than 4%.  

My issue is I see no real downfall with the DC plan (ie, shorter vest period, better return, if i died early my wife would get full value of funds).  With all positives I wanted to confirm I am not missing something.  Thank you in advance for any comments given.

Today I finally sat down and wanted to get my finances in order and saw that even in the most aggressive situation, would take a year to pay off my debts with sub $10K in savings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to get better at this, but am fearful that I don&amp;#39;t know enough about investing/saving/making the right financial moves to help me get to FI. What am I doing wrong? What can I do better? What goals should I be setting for myself?and most importantly... how do I start without getting overwhelmed in everything??? &lt;/p&gt;

As I consider my retirement savings plan, I realize I'm very late to the game and may never save a significant amount. Here was the short situation that got me thinking about just saving a decent amount of money.

So during EMT clinicals we spent an afternoon in a retirement home, taking vitals of residents, but really we just hung out with them for about 45 minutes. Well I get talking to this one lady and she explains her life story. In short, her husband had died a few years prior and when it was all said and done she had about $200,000 saved. As she grew old she needed to be moved to an assisted living facility, which costs tens of thousands of dollars a year. After her money was all gone due to costs, the private facility helped her get state insurance and she was moved to a very low quality facility. (By the way she never mentioned insurance, she just mentioned that it cost her out of pocket, I assume that insurance only covered part of her costs.) And the problem she faced was that she was unable to qualify for state assistance until she had exactly no money left. So now her only cash flow was some pittance check from the government for a few hundred dollars a month.

Now I'm not sure if she managed her money improperly or that because she lived so long (over 85 years old when I met her) that it didn't matter because someday eventually she was going to run out of funds and be forced into state insurance anyway. She had a reasonably large amount of money, by my standards, but it didn't matter for her situation at the end.

What do you guys think of this situation? When you save such a large amount of money and end up in a poor facility like she was in, is there any other solution than saving more? I imagine nobody thinks $200k is 'forever money' but it's also not nothing.

I'm in my early 40s now with far less wealth than I ever planned, even though it might seem a lot to some others. I have just passed the £400k mark ($516k) including all assets, house etc. From this point I'll only post figures in £ to keep things simple. My target for the lifestyle I ***want*** to live is £1.6m out of which we'll either rent or buy a place, so subtract the cost of house. The planning calculators I use tell me I will only be retiring in my early 50s, which is not what I wanted. I could retire on a lot less, but I don't think I'd be as happy. I like holidays, a lot. I want to take the whole family on one or two ski trips each year. I want to take them on other nice holidays each year. I want to own a good camper-van in the future (pricey to buy, pricey to maintain). While this isn't completely lavish, it does add up. Our target area for retirement is also not cheap. It is an area in France near the coast. We have friends and family there. I also want a nice house, since I've never lived in a really nice house myself. I come from a poor family, flat shared in London for most of my working life, and now mortgage on a small 60 sqm place in a modest area. So for me, it's a dream to live in a beautiful house in a nice area. Apart from that, I'm relatively frugal compared to friends. I take my own lunch to work, I make my own coffees, we don't eat out all that often, I've stopped blowing loads on nights out with friends. We prefer a walk on the river or hills to shopping. We run a 14 year old car, cheap to maintain which we consider value for money because we use it a lot. I earn \~£115k pa. After tax and expenses I save about £62k, which I think is a decent savings rate. I'm married but we've delayed having kids, though we both want two (yes, I'm going to be an old dad). That will increase my expenses in the future so the savings rate is going to go down, I expect, unless I can increase my income. My partner is not so much into FIRE. She also doesn't earn a lot (£32k pa). My asset distribution is liquid assets 90% equities, 10% cash for emergency. After a recent remortgage to extract equity, my house equity is about £70k. Value is about £450k. Our mortgage rate is 1.6% pa which is insanely cheap and I consider free money, hence I borrowed to add more to the market. If this changes, I will sell stocks and repay the mortgage. I don't own bonds because I'm taking a riskier approach to achieve my aims and I also consider my house to act like a bond. I live in London, HCOL area. I plan to use this house as either income or equity in the future to move to a only slightly LCOL area.

I summary, the choices I'm making about future retirement are conscious and I'm aware they push it further away. I'll continually revisit these choices.

Here are some of the mistakes I've made, my own fault or otherwise, while younger. This may prove useful to some people and I might even get advice out of this.

1. Not having anyone to give me sensible advice when I was young. I've always had a goal to retire young but had no-one explained to me fully the benefits of sacrifices while you are younger for huge compounded gains when older. I started making good money back when I left university in the late 90s (IT boom) and thought life would always be easy and I'd just save hard in the future and retire young. I made chunks of cash but I kept taking career breaks to go travelling for a year at a time over the next 15 years. As a result, I enjoyed my life immensely but never saved up a large amount (my savings always hovered around £50k).
2. I never bought a house while young. This was incredibly stupid. I flat shared for so many years and didn't click that in the UK you get tax breaks for having lodgers. I could have done the same thing (shared) but collected the income from the lodgers instead of the landlord doing this. I also would have benefited from the massive capital gains the UK has seen in the last two decades. Once I finally bought, I had to move to a worse area because the area I rented was out of my buying range. I don't see us experiencing the same house price growth over the next 10 years.
3. I fell in love with someone who isn't a high earner and isn't interested in being one. She is an amazing, interesting, funny, beautiful, kind, generous human. I'm unbelievably lucky to have her. She doesn't care about my money and constantly tells me we should just move to a cheap area in France now and we'll survive somehow. She comes from a moderately wealthy background but not rich. She's had her schooling and lifestyle funded by parents and I don't think realises what ""no safety net"" looks like. But for her, happiness in the moment and in her job is much more important now than happiness later. She doesn't look to the future and see that I just don't want to be tied down for another 20-30 years to any job. I want to be free to take whatever risk I want to take. My partner for me is not a mistake. I am so happy I found her. But if you can find the same partner, who also happens to earn a lot, even better. There is just no denying that a high earning partner will make one of the biggest differences to your FIRE ability out of anything.
4. Risk taking while young. The risks I took were quitting jobs and travelling. I loved it. I've had a great life. But I never took risks in my job. I always just took the next thing that was offered, decent pay but not spectacular, and got on with things. I hate interviewing and am not a salesperson (an interview is a sales pitch). I normally get the jobs that I interview for but I still hate the process. It was only much, much later in my career that I realised I was terrible at sales even when in a job and I therefore was the person who got things done, delivered on everything, exceeded expectations, got good reviews, but never got promoted. I didn't even care because I was always eyeing up my next mini-retirement. I now realise I should have used the system to my advantage and quite my jobs way more often for another job. I've been promoted and increased earnings several times in my career, but only through changing jobs. I should have done this more.
5. Not staying put and saving harder while younger. Career breaks are very, very expensive. Loss of earnings and outgoings, never mind opportunity cost for salary rises, etc. If current me could go back to younger me, I'd say ""quitting your job and travelling will be fun, but those memories will come at the massive sacrifice of a much longer working career"". I'd probably do it once, maybe twice, but not more. It is really hard to say this but I often just shake my head thinking I'm going to be working into my 50s to achieve what I thought I'd achieve in my mid 30s.
6. Learn about investing. Even now I'm stupidly uninformed compared to some, but I am now making the most of all the tax breaks I can and the low cost tracker funds. Back in my youth, apart from a few small pensions, I just dumped everything in a cash account earning around 4% at the time. Not bad for cash, but terrible for the long term.

I'm now at a relative peak in my current career. I'm not sure I'm management material as I find it hard to deal with the politics of this. I prefer the preciseness of the technical art where I know how to craft solutions. But... if I want to FIRE sooner, management would be a way to achieve it. I'm a likeable guy, I get along with pretty much everyone, I'm just not opinionated or outspoken or decisive enough. Maybe these are learnable skills.

Anyone in the same position where you're ~~slightly depressed~~ (edit) a little frustrated from time to time that you're going to be FIRE a lot later than you wanted? Any advice on ways to either deal with this or achieve aims sooner?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve created a new account for this post (and others I may make on this forum, because I give away more info than I&amp;#39;m usually prepared to).&lt;/p&gt;

I started making good money back when I left university in the late 90s (IT boom) and thought life would always be easy and I&amp;#39;d just save hard in the future and retire young. I made chunks of cash but I kept taking career breaks to go travelling for a year at a time over the next 15 years. As a result, I enjoyed my life immensely but never saved up a large amount (my savings always hovered around £50k).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never bought a house while young. This was incredibly stupid. I flat shared for so many years and didn&amp;#39;t click that in the UK you get tax breaks for having lodgers. I could have done the same thing (shared) but collected the income from the lodgers instead of the landlord doing this. I also would have benefited from the massive capital gains the UK has seen in the last two decades. Once I finally bought, I had to move to a worse area because the area I rented was out of my buying range. I don&amp;#39;t see us experiencing the same house price growth over the next 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I fell in love with someone who isn&amp;#39;t a high earner and isn&amp;#39;t interested in being one. She is an amazing, interesting, funny, beautiful, kind, generous human. I&amp;#39;m unbelievably lucky to have her. She doesn&amp;#39;t care about my money and constantly tells me we should just move to a cheap area in France now and we&amp;#39;ll survive somehow. She comes from a moderately wealthy background but not rich. She&amp;#39;s had her schooling and lifestyle funded by parents and I don&amp;#39;t think realises what &amp;quot;no safety net&amp;quot; looks like. But for her, happiness in the moment and in her job is much more important now than happiness later. She doesn&amp;#39;t look to the future and see that I just don&amp;#39;t want to be tied down for another 20-30 years to any job. I want to be free to take whatever risk I want to take. My partner for me is not a mistake. I am so happy I found her. But if you can find the same partner, who also happens to earn a lot, even better. There is just no denying that a high earning partner will make one of the biggest differences to your FIRE ability out of anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk taking while young. The risks I took were quitting jobs and travelling. I loved it. I&amp;#39;ve had a great life. But I never took risks in my job. I always just took the next thing that was offered, decent pay but not spectacular, and got on with things. I hate interviewing and am not a salesperson (an interview is a sales pitch). I normally get the jobs that I interview for but I still hate the process. It was only much, much later in my career that I realised I was terrible at sales even when in a job and I therefore was the person who got things done, delivered on everything, exceeded expectations, got good reviews, but never got promoted. I didn&amp;#39;t even care because I was always eyeing up my next mini-retirement. I now realise I should have used the system to my advantage and quite my jobs way more often for another job. I&amp;#39;ve been promoted and increased earnings several times in my career, but only through changing jobs. I should have done this more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not staying put and saving harder while younger. Career breaks are very, very expensive. Loss of earnings and outgoings, never mind opportunity cost for salary rises, etc. If current me could go back to younger me, I&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;quitting your job and travelling will be fun, but those memories will come at the massive sacrifice of a much longer working career&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;d probably do it once, maybe twice, but not more. It is really hard to say this but I often just shake my head thinking I&amp;#39;m going to be working into my 50s to achieve what I thought I&amp;#39;d achieve in my mid 30s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about investing. Even now I&amp;#39;m stupidly uninformed compared to some, but I am now making the most of all the tax breaks I can and the low cost tracker funds. Back in my youth, apart from a few small pensions, I just dumped everything in a cash account earning around 4% at the time. Not bad for cash, but terrible for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now at a relative peak in my current career. I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m management material as I find it hard to deal with the politics of this. I prefer the preciseness of the technical art where I know how to craft solutions. But... if I want to FIRE sooner, management would be a way to achieve it. I&amp;#39;m a likeable guy, I get along with pretty much everyone, I&amp;#39;m just not opinionated or outspoken or decisive enough. Maybe these are learnable skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone in the same position where you&amp;#39;re &lt;del&gt;slightly depressed&lt;/del&gt; (edit) a little frustrated from time to time that you&amp;#39;re going to be FIRE a lot later than you wanted? Any advice on ways to either deal with this or achieve aims sooner?&lt;/p&gt;

· Total monthly rental income is hedged 5% to account for occupancy issues.

· The property increases at 4% p.a. This is another conservative measure compared to the 5.4% figure I found online for average RE appreciation.

· The IRR is calc’d based on the opportunity cost of the 30k home equity loan at the going average rate.

· The rental income is enough to cover mortgage and the initial home equity loan. After the loan is paid off, the funds that were paying the home equity loan are then used to pay an additional amount of the mortgage per month.

Like many users on this sub, I'm not ready to retire yet: I'm in my early 30s, enjoy variously aspects of my job (though I might switch companies), and most importantly don't have the rest of life figured out yet. No family yet, and only just starting to build up the right set of hobbies to retire to. So the plan is to keep working while it's enjoyable, and focus on building a great life outside of work.

One interesting thing that I've noticed is that at this juncture, a core FIRE strategy (keeping lifestyle inflation in check) starts to break down. I call this the post-scarcity phase. All needs are met, and all earnings go towards chubby-fying or de-risking retirement. (I'm not interested in de-risking because I picked withdrawal rate that is low enough that there's little benefit in reducing risk)

So how should spending work in the post-scarcity phase? If I'm not increasing spending now, then I'm just hoarding cash to later more drastically increase spending. It makes no sense for example, to keep spending at X until retirement, then retire to spending 3X. 

A fun thing that I've started doing as a solution to this ""problem"" is pegging my spending to my portfolio size, even while working. Instead spending a fixed X/year, I'm switching to spending 3.5% of my invested assets per year.

Some interesting observations:  
* Spending is not tied to my job or my earnings - if I switch jobs, I'll still spend the same amount  
* If I work hard and bring in a lot of income for a few years, I'm effectively giving myself a permanent raise for the rest of my life, starting immediately  
* If my invested assets increase by 10%, my spending increases by 10%  
* At some point, my income can become lower than 3.5% of my portfolio size, so I'll be spending more than I earn (and that's ok!)  
* Some years I may see a spending cut (years where market losses are higher than my income)  
* The year I retire and switch to the more standard inflation adjusted fixed withdrawal strategy, I won't see a large change in spending  
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I crossed the threshold where I&amp;#39;m technically financially independent: the safe withdrawal rate of my investments is more than my yearly spending.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many users on this sub, I&amp;#39;m not ready to retire yet: I&amp;#39;m in my early 30s, enjoy variously aspects of my job (though I might switch companies), and most importantly don&amp;#39;t have the rest of life figured out yet. No family yet, and only just starting to build up the right set of hobbies to retire to. So the plan is to keep working while it&amp;#39;s enjoyable, and focus on building a great life outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing that I&amp;#39;ve noticed is that at this juncture, a core FIRE strategy (keeping lifestyle inflation in check) starts to break down. I call this the post-scarcity phase. All needs are met, and all earnings go towards chubby-fying or de-risking retirement. (I&amp;#39;m not interested in de-risking because I picked withdrawal rate that is low enough that there&amp;#39;s little benefit in reducing risk)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how should spending work in the post-scarcity phase? If I&amp;#39;m not increasing spending now, then I&amp;#39;m just hoarding cash to later more drastically increase spending. It makes no sense for example, to keep spending at X until retirement, then retire to spending 3X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fun thing that I&amp;#39;ve started doing as a solution to this &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; is pegging my spending to my portfolio size, even while working. Instead spending a fixed X/year, I&amp;#39;m switching to spending 3.5% of my invested assets per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting observations:&lt;br/&gt;
* Spending is not tied to my job or my earnings - if I switch jobs, I&amp;#39;ll still spend the same amount&lt;br/&gt;
* If I work hard and bring in a lot of income for a few years, I&amp;#39;m effectively giving myself a permanent raise for the rest of my life, starting immediately&lt;br/&gt;
* If my invested assets increase by 10%, my spending increases by 10%&lt;br/&gt;
* At some point, my income can become lower than 3.5% of my portfolio size, so I&amp;#39;ll be spending more than I earn (and that&amp;#39;s ok!)&lt;br/&gt;
* Some years I may see a spending cut (years where market losses are higher than my income)&lt;br/&gt;
* The year I retire and switch to the more standard inflation adjusted fixed withdrawal strategy, I won&amp;#39;t see a large change in spending  &lt;/p&gt;

due to my upbringing, i never trusted investment into shares etc.  all of my monies are in property.

here's the fact.

i have an investment condo in central London with mortgage. my net profit after tax and expenses is about £400 per month. this is not much but i am planning to sell it later in life if i need cash for nursing home. if i sell it now, i can make about £300k in profit.

my main residence in London is fully paid for. i can rent it out long term and make a profit of at least £3000 per month after tax.

if my wife and i were to quit now and go Airbnb around the world, we have £3400 spending cash coming to us every month.

we want to spend the next ten years living in places like south America, southern Italy, some places in Asia. 

maybe after that, we will come back to UK. sell the investment property and buy a small cheap place for ourselves.

i know rental is subject to market movement and sometimes it is left empty. i have been in this business for more than 20 years.

any flaw in this plan?

we are counting on the NHS for medical cover if we need to.

For the purposes of this thread, there really is no debate for me - my wife and I have agreed to take care of my Mother in Law when she is older. The question is how to do it in a way that does not greatly impede our path to FI, which we hope to achieve in 10-15 years (currently 30).

So I came up with a plan. My MiL will be immigrating to the US sometime in the coming year. She will be a green card holder for 5 years then become a citizen via naturalization. She has no assets and no income. My plan is to make sure that she has at least access to minimum social security benefits, and more importantly, Medicare coverage, after 10 years.

The plan is to hire my MiL as a 1099 contractor to help out with house cleaning and babysitting. She will be living with us rent free. I plan on paying her the federal minimum to qualify for SS, which I believe is around 5k to 6k a year. Doing so as a 1099 contractor will ensure I do not get tangled with employee taxes. My MiL will file her own taxes with quarterly withholdings, which will not be much given the low income. This way, after 10 years of work, she will be approximately 65, and will be able to qualify for a very small SS benefit, but more importantly, access to Medicare A coverage. 

The cost of this arrangement for me and my wife is basically the payment of $5k to $6k annually to my MiL for 10 years.  I think this is the best way for us to brace ourselves for the likely high amount of medical expenses that will come our way when she gets older.  Plus, the added benefit is that my MiL will have some spending money, plus we are getting a very useful service in return (my wife and I are really lazy people and our house is a mess).  Is there a down side to this?  Given that not caring for my MiL is not an option, paying 50-60k over 10 years to ensure that she has at least some sort of safety net is a pretty good tradeoff, right? According to my calculations, it should delay our FIRE path by only one year, which is not bad at all considering the peace of mind we will have with my MiL's care.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that parental care has always been a hot button issue in this sub.

&lt;p&gt;D0/monthly).etails:  Single/no kids in MCOL city working from home (renting).  ~95k income with 8% annual bonus (income was in the 40s/50s up until about 3 years ago).  ~$55k in 401k, ~15k in emergency fund (regular Chase savings), no debt, no car.  My budget is below (just finished reviewing my expenses in Mint for the first half of this year for the first time ever).  Small *private* pension possible at age 65 (sample amount:  it reaches ~1k/monthly around age 46)...*no* COLA.  ETA:  I&amp;#39;m saving 15% into the 401k (~950/monthly) and my employer matches 5% (~15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have trouble strategizing a long term plan and am trying to figure out if I can COAST fire and if so, how soon?  50 is ideal.  From what I&amp;#39;m seeing my expenses are roughly ~36k...I can&amp;#39;t wait until I have a million to quit working (high stress job, burnout, etc., etc.,).  Thoughts?  Things I can to do get to coast FIRE quickly?  (I thought about buying a home and renting out a room or two to cover my mortgage as being a potential option to move things along.)  Just trying to get an idea of what others would do (where you would cut, where you&amp;#39;d be putting that $1500, if you&amp;#39;d divert any savings to a house down payment, what age you&amp;#39;d shoot for to coast, etc. etc. etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

I currently work as a CPA in a higher cost of living area. I'm only about two years into my career.  I really enjoy my job for the most part, but as with all jobs there are a few things I don't love (45 min commute to clients, stress, ect...). Recently, I heard about a job opening in my hometown (tiny town 2k population) that sounds really tempting, but I just want to make sure I consider everything before making a decision.  

The job in my hometown would come with a modest salary increase ($15-20 k), decrease in stress, and a 5-10 minute drive to work.  I also have the option to purchase a home that would significantly reduce my mortgage (about $150k in debt reduction). I'd probably have a lot more fun as well because I'd be a lot closer to my hobbies. I'd probably also see a reduction in hours worked per year 200-300 hours 

The largest drawback I see is that the potential for salary growth is very limited. I'd be right below the CFO at the company, so to advance, the company would either need to grow dramatically (not highly likely) or the CFO would need to retire.  At my current job the income potential is much higher, but I'm not sure I want to grind out 3-4 more years in public accounting to start to see that benefit. 

Before I make any decisions I just really want to get a 3rd party view point on what factors I should consider. I've talked to a couple of my managers but I think they have a lot of bias towards staying because that's the decision they made. Other staff/senior level employees have told me to take it, but I also feel like they don't have a lot of new perspective to add because our situations are so similar. 

I have another interview on Thursday with the company. It's fairly likely I'll get a job offer.  

Is there anything specific you would consider before making a decision?

If I FIREd today, my first-year withdrawal rate would be a very safe &lt;3% because:

* **Taxes:**  Most of my assets are in Roth accounts and taxable accounts with high cost bases and most of my income would be dividends and capital gains.  Therefore, taxes (both federal and state) would consume no more than 5% of my withdrawals even if I started a Roth conversion ladder with my small traditional IRA.
* **Healthcare:**  I'm young and healthy and would likely qualify for substantial ACA tax credits.
* **Housing:**  My rent is a couple hundred dollars a month below market because I snagged a rent-controlled apartment at the right time.

On the other hand, I expect my expenses to rise much faster than inflation over the first 25-30 years because:

* **Taxes:**  The government's running huge deficits, so the favorable rates on dividends and capital gains may go away.  Furthermore, my investments will have hopefully appreciated, so a larger portion of my withdrawals will be gains rather than cost basis.
* **Healthcare:**  I'll be getting older and there's tremendous uncertainty around ACA subsidies.
* **Housing:**  If I ever want/need to move for any reason or if rent control laws change, I'll be forced to start paying market rent.

I feel like I've hit a wall at my current company in terms advancement opportunities.  Our main competitor is headquartered in Philly, and has an opening for a director level position.  The interviews are going well, and the ballpark salary is around $140k.

My preliminary research shows that Philly is a cheaper city than Boston, so a big salary increase + lower CoL is a double win, and will accelerate FI.  Having said that, I've also read that Philly is dirty, has a fairly large homeless and drug problem, and higher crime rates overall.

All of my family and friends live in Boston.  I wouldn't know anyone in Philly.  The salary increase would be so high though, that I feel like I need to take it just to set the bar for future negotiations with other companies.

**I left this out of the original post, but I do have one parent and one grandparent with health issues.  Though they are both improving, part of me feels selfish for leaving the other parent to care for both by herself.  As people said though, the plane ride is quite short, so it wouldn't be hard to visit often.**

**Update 2: Crazy day!  I just heard back from another company in NYC to which I had applied several weeks ago.  Salary is likely higher than $140k, but CoL is also much higher.  Let's see if I can leverage the potential offers against each other.  Never been in such a fortunate position before.  It seems to pay not to be complacent, and to look for opportunities outside of your home city if possible.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 32, single, and have grown up in the Boston area all my life.  I&amp;#39;ve never lived in another city.  I&amp;#39;ve worked for the same company, in a niche industry, for 10 years, and make high $80s to low $90s.  Net worth is $450k.  Currently save 45% of gross salary, and I plan to be financially independent by mid 40s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;ve hit a wall at my current company in terms advancement opportunities.  Our main competitor is headquartered in Philly, and has an opening for a director level position.  The interviews are going well, and the ballpark salary is around $140k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My preliminary research shows that Philly is a cheaper city than Boston, so a big salary increase + lower CoL is a double win, and will accelerate FI.  Having said that, I&amp;#39;ve also read that Philly is dirty, has a fairly large homeless and drug problem, and higher crime rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my family and friends live in Boston.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t know anyone in Philly.  The salary increase would be so high though, that I feel like I need to take it just to set the bar for future negotiations with other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

It's really great to see all of these interpretations of my post. Seeing what each person gets out of it is super cool and kinda fun to see what part of the post they resonate with vs what they do not. I'll go ahead and give my clarification for what I meant, but feel free to continue seeing it as you do!  

1. For context, this came about after a break up where I realized my life had been stagnant and unchanged for multiple years. I was 21 when I started to work, and 26 when I wrote that post. In that time my life was very much the same. I lived in the same crappy cheap apartment, I worked at the same company (diff position for higher money, but still same place and city), I ate at the same restaurants ordering the same things, and I simply didn't have any life changing experiences in that time. I was still afraid of the ocean/sharks, I still had negative feelings towards bars and going out, I constantly scrutinized costs for everything, and more. This final point was a big piece of it for me, because I felt like I simply had stopped learning/growing outside of learning new skills for my job. The only thing that changed in my life was the size of my nest egg, which I used to obsess over but eventually I realized that more money wasn't generating anymore happiness, and my side hustle starting/growing (Twitch streaming).
2. At that point I realized how miserable I had become. I thought I was doing things right. Saving 75% of my income, starting a side hustle, having my gf, working out, etc. But I wasn't happy. I wasn't growing, I wasn't changing, I was simply sacrificing my time for money for the sake of retiring without knowing what the heck I was going to retire to. I had a very simple picture in my life of like ""well I'll do what I want"" but I hadn't even tried a lot of the stuff I was considering. And around that point I decided it was time to change sooner rather than later, because life is too short to willingly be miserable right now.  
3. So I sat down and wrote the email that I talked about in my updated post. I sought out others to help push me to grow and change myself for the better. I gave myself a happiness budget and accepted that I might work a little bit longer (it's shorter than you think it would be) in order to be happy now and to find what I want in the future. Maybe I realize I don't want any luxuries, maybe I find something that is a bit expensive but is WORTH working an extra month or two in my life for, I didn't know but it was worth checking out. Over the course of the next year I did everything I possibly could and faced as many fears as I could as well. And it grew me up. It grew me to realize how beautiful life is and that there are some things that I want to work for and that gave me a bit more purpose. Scuba diving cost me $2000 for a week long trip + $400 in gear. This was the most expensive of the activities but it was worth it to me because it started the chain of conquering my fears. Being 100ft down in this beautiful alien underworld staring a shark in the face reminded me of this quote: 

&gt; I would rather be ashes than dust! 
I would rather that my spark should burn out 
    in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. 
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom 
    of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. 
The function of man is to live, not to exist. 
I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. 
I shall use my time.  -Jack London's ""Credo""

4. I would rather be ashes than dust. It was the perfect summation for the last 5 years of my life. I was sitting there as dust gathering on my boring stable life. And as that moment passed I realized I would rather have gone SCUBA diving and had something gone wrong than been afraid of diving and living in fear of it my whole life. After that trip was over, I found myself not caring to add diving in as a yearly expense or anything as the price tag was a bit high for my enjoyment level, but I am 100% happy I took the plunge and did it once because of the life lesson and value gained from it there. This is something that I think a lot of people in this sub don't appreciate enough, the value of happiness and life lessons that may be gained from spending money in certain situations.  
5. After SCUBA was my ski trip which I have talked at lengths about but I'll mention again. I didn't want to go. I thought, ""I don't like the cold, it seems kinda boring, expensive, and tedious, and I could probably have just as much fun playing a video game or reading a book or something."" I actually told my friend I wasn't planning on going until she said something along the lines of, ""Isn't the whole point of this year to change your lifestyle and stop being a negative scrooge who thinks they know everything about happiness?"" So I went. And just like the SCUBA trip changed me for the better, so did the ski trip. First thing I realized was how little I knew about my true happiness and love for life. I would have bet anybody $1000 that I would not enjoy skiing before I went, but I would have lost it so easily. I loved skiing. Standing up at the top of 12K ft overlooking the Rockies was worth the price alone, but it was so much better than that. I loved the snow, the trees, the challenge, the speed, etc. I thought I would be miserable worrying about the money I had spent the whole trip but I simply was too happy to even care. Of course I had planned the trip on the best budget I could and found the best deals I could to keep it from being too expensive, so it was no longer time to worry. So I didn't.  And after the ski trip was over I realized for the first time in my life I found something beyond ""I want to retire because I don't like working and being in the rat race"" as a reason for saving money.  
6. The rest of the year continued like this. I listed the more expensive activities but many of them were free. Sometimes it was just driving to a new city and grabbing lunch, other times it was going out in a state park and hiking to a waterfall, and many times I pushed myself to try new things whenever I could. That $25 class was no longer just ""a wasted expense"" but a time that I could learn about my interests and push myself. At restaurants I would tell the waiter/waitress to order me their favorite dish on the menu without telling me what it was. If there was ever something I was afraid of doing I would go do it. My fears were irrational in many cases (as they many times are) and I started to see that my fear of spending money on anything had been limiting my life as well. And at the end of the year I had a giant list of new interests, foods, places, and desires that I never knew I wanted in my life; and with that came more happiness and confidence than I ever thought possible. The previous me would have laughed at the current me and said, ""What a waste. Sounds like someone who got roped into living a lavish lifestyle and now is gonna be a sucker to it for the rest of their life."" But it's just simply not that. It's 1000x better than that.  

8. I don't think money buys happiness nor do I think you need all of these luxuries in life, but I do think it's always worth pushing yourself and your barriers to continue growing and then trusting that you will make smart decisions in the future. Is it really so bad that current me has decided to budget for skiing in the future? Past me would think so, but that's silly! Current me is smart enough to weigh the value of more money vs skiing and determine if the happiness gained is greater than or less than the extra months of work. So trust future self to make smart decisions. We are all AMAZING savers here with some of the best money handling skills in the world. And this money spent didn't even really affect my FI date. I thought it would set me back years but it set me back like...1 month. And if I wanted to add in some expensive activity like a ski trip every year it set me back...1 more month. So it was simply a no brainer for me and it's ridiculous how I used to get so up in arms about things like this. And what's crazier is how I used to think I would let it spiral out of control. ""Well first I'll be okay with a ski trip, then I'll be wanting $5000 skis and I'll be flying first class to the Swiss Alps and I'll have completely lost myself!"" I had such a fear of losing myself to lifestyle inflation without giving my future self any credit for being responsible. Once again, I was living with an irrational fear. In the end I would rather be happy and working now than miserable and working 2 months less in my life.    

So that's where the phrase ""Build the life you want, then save for it"" came from. I don't just mean plan it, I mean start living it and experiencing it. Don't just build that list of stuff you want for the future, build it for the now too. Why do we pride ourselves so much on our ability to be miserable now? We always talk about how we ""sacrifice"" so that we can stop working faster. Why isn't living the happiest life while saving money our goal? It feels like we get so caught up in competing (with others or even simply ourselves) that we drive ourselves into a bit of that misery. And I don't speak for everyone, but I speak for the person I was before and for those I see around here who are in that same spot and mindset. For the people who talk about money not equaling happiness but watch/update their spreadsheets daily, check the market daily to see any gains/losses, and celebrate all the money milestones along the way.

-Llama","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;re all pretty sick of hearing/reading about this by now, but I felt like there was still a lot of discussion going around the &amp;quot;true meaning&amp;quot; of the post so I&amp;#39;m gonna lay my thoughts down on it and we can call it good.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really great to see all of these interpretations of my post. Seeing what each person gets out of it is super cool and kinda fun to see what part of the post they resonate with vs what they do not. I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and give my clarification for what I meant, but feel free to continue seeing it as you do!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For context, this came about after a break up where I realized my life had been stagnant and unchanged for multiple years. I was 21 when I started to work, and 26 when I wrote that post. In that time my life was very much the same. I lived in the same crappy cheap apartment, I worked at the same company (diff position for higher money, but still same place and city), I ate at the same restaurants ordering the same things, and I simply didn&amp;#39;t have any life changing experiences in that time. I was still afraid of the ocean/sharks, I still had negative feelings towards bars and going out, I constantly scrutinized costs for everything, and more. This final point was a big piece of it for me, because I felt like I simply had stopped learning/growing outside of learning new skills for my job. The only thing that changed in my life was the size of my nest egg, which I used to obsess over but eventually I realized that more money wasn&amp;#39;t generating anymore happiness, and my side hustle starting/growing (Twitch streaming).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that point I realized how miserable I had become. I thought I was doing things right. Saving 75% of my income, starting a side hustle, having my gf, working out, etc. But I wasn&amp;#39;t happy. I wasn&amp;#39;t growing, I wasn&amp;#39;t changing, I was simply sacrificing my time for money for the sake of retiring without knowing what the heck I was going to retire to. I had a very simple picture in my life of like &amp;quot;well I&amp;#39;ll do what I want&amp;quot; but I hadn&amp;#39;t even tried a lot of the stuff I was considering. And around that point I decided it was time to change sooner rather than later, because life is too short to willingly be miserable right now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I sat down and wrote the email that I talked about in my updated post. I sought out others to help push me to grow and change myself for the better. I gave myself a happiness budget and accepted that I might work a little bit longer (it&amp;#39;s shorter than you think it would be) in order to be happy now and to find what I want in the future. Maybe I realize I don&amp;#39;t want any luxuries, maybe I find something that is a bit expensive but is WORTH working an extra month or two in my life for, I didn&amp;#39;t know but it was worth checking out. Over the course of the next year I did everything I possibly could and faced as many fears as I could as well. And it grew me up. It grew me to realize how beautiful life is and that there are some things that I want to work for and that gave me a bit more purpose. Scuba diving cost me $2000 for a week long trip + $400 in gear. This was the most expensive of the activities but it was worth it to me because it started the chain of conquering my fears. Being 100ft down in this beautiful alien underworld staring a shark in the face reminded me of this quote: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather be ashes than dust! 
I would rather that my spark should burn out 
    in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. 
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom 
    of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. 
The function of man is to live, not to exist. 
I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. 
I shall use my time.  -Jack London&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Credo&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would rather be ashes than dust. It was the perfect summation for the last 5 years of my life. I was sitting there as dust gathering on my boring stable life. And as that moment passed I realized I would rather have gone SCUBA diving and had something gone wrong than been afraid of diving and living in fear of it my whole life. After that trip was over, I found myself not caring to add diving in as a yearly expense or anything as the price tag was a bit high for my enjoyment level, but I am 100% happy I took the plunge and did it once because of the life lesson and value gained from it there. This is something that I think a lot of people in this sub don&amp;#39;t appreciate enough, the value of happiness and life lessons that may be gained from spending money in certain situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After SCUBA was my ski trip which I have talked at lengths about but I&amp;#39;ll mention again. I didn&amp;#39;t want to go. I thought, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like the cold, it seems kinda boring, expensive, and tedious, and I could probably have just as much fun playing a video game or reading a book or something.&amp;quot; I actually told my friend I wasn&amp;#39;t planning on going until she said something along the lines of, &amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t the whole point of this year to change your lifestyle and stop being a negative scrooge who thinks they know everything about happiness?&amp;quot; So I went. And just like the SCUBA trip changed me for the better, so did the ski trip. First thing I realized was how little I knew about my true happiness and love for life. I would have bet anybody $1000 that I would not enjoy skiing before I went, but I would have lost it so easily. I loved skiing. Standing up at the top of 12K ft overlooking the Rockies was worth the price alone, but it was so much better than that. I loved the snow, the trees, the challenge, the speed, etc. I thought I would be miserable worrying about the money I had spent the whole trip but I simply was too happy to even care. Of course I had planned the trip on the best budget I could and found the best deals I could to keep it from being too expensive, so it was no longer time to worry. So I didn&amp;#39;t.  And after the ski trip was over I realized for the first time in my life I found something beyond &amp;quot;I want to retire because I don&amp;#39;t like working and being in the rat race&amp;quot; as a reason for saving money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the year continued like this. I listed the more expensive activities but many of them were free. Sometimes it was just driving to a new city and grabbing lunch, other times it was going out in a state park and hiking to a waterfall, and many times I pushed myself to try new things whenever I could. That $25 class was no longer just &amp;quot;a wasted expense&amp;quot; but a time that I could learn about my interests and push myself. At restaurants I would tell the waiter/waitress to order me their favorite dish on the menu without telling me what it was. If there was ever something I was afraid of doing I would go do it. My fears were irrational in many cases (as they many times are) and I started to see that my fear of spending money on anything had been limiting my life as well. And at the end of the year I had a giant list of new interests, foods, places, and desires that I never knew I wanted in my life; and with that came more happiness and confidence than I ever thought possible. The previous me would have laughed at the current me and said, &amp;quot;What a waste. Sounds like someone who got roped into living a lavish lifestyle and now is gonna be a sucker to it for the rest of their life.&amp;quot; But it&amp;#39;s just simply not that. It&amp;#39;s 1000x better than that.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think money buys happiness nor do I think you need all of these luxuries in life, but I do think it&amp;#39;s always worth pushing yourself and your barriers to continue growing and then trusting that you will make smart decisions in the future. Is it really so bad that current me has decided to budget for skiing in the future? Past me would think so, but that&amp;#39;s silly! Current me is smart enough to weigh the value of more money vs skiing and determine if the happiness gained is greater than or less than the extra months of work. So trust future self to make smart decisions. We are all AMAZING savers here with some of the best money handling skills in the world. And this money spent didn&amp;#39;t even really affect my FI date. I thought it would set me back years but it set me back like...1 month. And if I wanted to add in some expensive activity like a ski trip every year it set me back...1 more month. So it was simply a no brainer for me and it&amp;#39;s ridiculous how I used to get so up in arms about things like this. And what&amp;#39;s crazier is how I used to think I would let it spiral out of control. &amp;quot;Well first I&amp;#39;ll be okay with a ski trip, then I&amp;#39;ll be wanting $5000 skis and I&amp;#39;ll be flying first class to the Swiss Alps and I&amp;#39;ll have completely lost myself!&amp;quot; I had such a fear of losing myself to lifestyle inflation without giving my future self any credit for being responsible. Once again, I was living with an irrational fear. In the end I would rather be happy and working now than miserable and working 2 months less in my life.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s where the phrase &amp;quot;Build the life you want, then save for it&amp;quot; came from. I don&amp;#39;t just mean plan it, I mean start living it and experiencing it. Don&amp;#39;t just build that list of stuff you want for the future, build it for the now too. Why do we pride ourselves so much on our ability to be miserable now? We always talk about how we &amp;quot;sacrifice&amp;quot; so that we can stop working faster. Why isn&amp;#39;t living the happiest life while saving money our goal? It feels like we get so caught up in competing (with others or even simply ourselves) that we drive ourselves into a bit of that misery. And I don&amp;#39;t speak for everyone, but I speak for the person I was before and for those I see around here who are in that same spot and mindset. For the people who talk about money not equaling happiness but watch/update their spreadsheets daily, check the market daily to see any gains/losses, and celebrate all the money milestones along the way.

I'm 99% sure I know what my decision will be, but I figured I'd throw it out for discussion since it hits some common dilemmas in this community.  

I'm a veterinarian who does relief work - aka locums or being a substitute vet.  I contract to fill in with clinics who are short staffed.  The change from being a regular employee of a clinic has been wonderful, and it has allowed me to take big chunks of time off for pursuing personal goals (mostly long distance hiking) while still making a good salary.  I'm planning to move in a few months and have just started lining up work in the new state.  My old employer is a large corporation that has a significant presence in the new city.  They offered a signing bonus equivalent to 30-40% of my annual salary if I sign a 2 year full time contract with them.  This was tempting, as I didn't hate working for them, the benefits are good, and the bonus could go straight to stocks or the down payment on an investment property.  There are definitely some aspects of working for a large corporation that I disliked and would have to suck it up and deal with if I took the position, but over all it wouldn't be terrible.  My salary outside the bonus would be equivalent or slightly less than what I can make now after equalizing hours worked and accounting for the additional costs of self employment.  

I'm currently in a good financial position (no debt, 40-50% savings rate despite only working 8-9 months per year the last few years).  I estimate I can hit FI in 7-10 years if I continue my current lifestyle of spending a few months traveling and volunteering each year and working hard the remainder of the year.  This would be more like 5 years if I worked full time with only 2-3 weeks/year off to boost savings.  However, I really like my lifestyle now.  I get to make my own schedule, work in a variety of practice settings, and don't have to ask anybody for permission when I want time away.   I enjoy the challenge of adapting my practice style to different clinics and teams every day.  While I plan to do less paid work and get pickier about the contracts I accept after FI, I don't really feel the need to sacrifice the current lifestyle in order to hit a magic number faster.  The bonus would take maybe a few months off of my FI date. 

So - I'm thinking about it, but I'm probably going to turn the offer down and continue my current gig.  I've said repeatedly that I will never go back to being an employee, but this was enough money to at least make me consider.  If it were 80% of my annual salary or a shorter commitment, the answer would probably be yes.  What would you do in a similar situation?  Would you sacrifice a little bit in lifestyle for 2 years in exchange for a cash infusion that would put you a few months closer to FI?

You decide on some withdrawal rate you're comfortable (4%, 3%, whatever).

You adjust that each year to take into account inflation from the CPI.

When you take out the 4%, is that done at the beginning of each year, or incrementally over each month? Does it matter?

The 4% you take out in subsequent years, is that 4% of your original balance (plus inflation) or 4% of your current balance?

Very into the idea of FIRE and planning on following through

Idea: take the first year out of college and first year of employment making a real salary to take a financial Gap Year: create a reasonable (3 month) emergency fund, pay for typical expenses and start payments on student loans.

But then spend your money. I'm not talking insane lifestyle inflation or world class travel, but maybe spend a couple grand building a PC battlestation I'd want to come home to every day after work for years to come, put together a down payment on a truck and house, buy a quality mattress and house tools (vacuum, small appliances, pressure washer), a quality set of winter tires, etc. This would take the place of saving for retirement for one year.

The thought is to front load the large costs of life in order to 
""Build the life you want to save for"" quickly and then kinda be set and maybe have to replace that vacuum in 8 years or only need to buy a new GPU in a few years. Also have money for down payments on a house/vehicle in order to go right into affordable payments the next year so that a Savings Rate of 60% is possible. 

Conclusion: I know it's a pretty radical idea, especially in this sub. I think the main arguments against it will be that saving money as early as possible brings the most returns and it's easier to save money when you're used to it. I'd counter by saying a reasonable person is able to cut back to a managable budget (as long as there aren't committed expenses) and having ""stuff"" you actually like and want to come home to might make saving easier, as you aren't constantly pining for something that you really want.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since got a nice 6 figure job(been here 6 years), bought a nice house, paid off all student loans, have zero missed credit card payments, and a decent 401k started that will be very comfortable when I&amp;#39;m 65(40 years from now). Seems like I&amp;#39;ve accomplished everything I set out to do correct so what the problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been writing and performing music for 17 years now and LOVE it. I literally hate engineering. It can be interesting at times however it&amp;#39;s just not what I&amp;#39;m passionate about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a point in my life where I&amp;#39;m so committed to maintaining my financial independence that I&amp;#39;m afraid of the risk of doing what I love and being happy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how any of this is relevant but I suppose that I  just needed to say it out loud so that I could read the truth of what I&amp;#39;ve done to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe some of you are going through similar times....&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a hypothetical:

1.)  You buy commercial property for $100k (completely paid off) and the rent you collect per year is $10k.  After repairs/fees/property tax that dwindles down to $8k.  That is 8% per year assuming it is always occupied.  Note that you have no plans on selling this property ever because you want it to be your passive income stream so you can FIRE.  Also note that you increase rent by only 2% per year.  So assuming costs remain constant at about $2k/year (which is unlikely) and the place is ALWAYS occupied for 20 years that is a total of: $202,973.69 pre-tax.  I'd argue it'd be lower than this because the place won't always be occupied and fees/repairs/property tax will go but anyway....ideal situation.

2.)  You invest $100k in some low cost index fund that, over 15-25 years averages about 7% yearly.  After 20 years that is (assuming no more contributions):  $386,968 pre-tax

It seems like real estate is never the right answer if you want to FIRE off of it...or am I missing something.  The only way the real estate answer is better in the above scenario is if the value of the property goes up a lot over 10 years and you sell it.  But then you lose your passive income stream.

Is one of the reasons you want to FIRE the freedom to have more time to see the world?

It is for me.  And I'm wondering if I'm just the right plan away from being able to do it sooner rather than  later.  I'm 39 and don't really want to wait until FIRE to travel more - right now with a full time job, I'm not squeezing in any more than 2 one week long international trips anywhere within a year.  I really would like to change this and am just trying to figure out how.  

Next spring I will have been working from home for 2 years.  I think that's enough time for my employer (large global firm) to trust I can do my job from anywhere so this should be a huge advantage for me and I'm basically trying to figure out how to take more advantage of it from a travel perspective.  A few random ideas I've had:

\-Home exchanges:  Major pro is they're free.  I joined a Home Exchange site 2.5 years ago and had lots of requests to do exchanges when I was living in Chicago, but none now that I live in Atlanta.  Another con is I'm renting so might be risky.

\-Ditching a permanent residence:  I thought about perhaps just renting in one country for a few months, then moving on to the next one.  I do strongly prefer having a base to come back to so would need to do a ton of research on this option.

\-Buy a home with tenants and travel while using the home as my base:  Seems the least risky approach but then I'd have the new experience of landlording at the same time I'd be traveling off and on.

I just don't want too many years to pass by while I continue to do the 2 one-week vacation a year thing because I don't want to look back in 25 years and say ""Man, you sure wasted a huge opportunity to do nearly-free travel while you were still working instead of waiting until FIRE to do it all!""

I&amp;#39;m not sure I completely follow that line of thinking, but I also understand that if that information were to get out, there might be conflict within organizations or friends/families. Then again, some companies willingly publicize their salaries (though not many). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your lead-up to financial independence, do you personally consider your salary to be a secret? Meaning...would you like it to be one, or do you not care who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And...if your salary weren&amp;#39;t a secret, what&amp;#39;s the worst thing that you think could happen to you? &lt;/p&gt;

For instance, this post: [Link](https://www.kitces.com/blog/managing-portfolio-size-effect-with-bond-tent-in-retirement-red-zone/)


Obviously, minimizing sequence of return risk is very important. However, one strategy that I don't seem to see very often is the use of long-dated LEAPs to help protect the value of a portfolio in those early years of retirement, or the few years leading up to it. Granted, put options are more or less an insurance product, so they come with a cost. However, in a very real sense, tying up a lot of money in bonds is also expensive from an opportunity cost perspective - those funds could be in potentially higher yielding stocks.

I am a very long ways from retirement so this is mostly an academic exercise. My thoughts are: To hedge a portfolio, I could consider using SPY options as they are the most liquid options out there. I realize that SPY options do not properly protect a well-diversified equities portfolio that contains overseas equities, but SPY is the most useful and the easiest way to price LEAPS, so that is what I am using for this scenario.

So, I drew up a couple of ideas.


1. I am willing to tolerate a ~15% drop in the equity portion of my portfolio. This is what most market corrections usually encompass. Choosing an 85% below current level of value seems to hit a ""value"" price point of put options. If the market drops more than 85%, then the options I've purchased really do their job well.

2. This is assuming I have a large enough portfolio that my LEAPS will be able to be sold one at a time - ie - I am not using one LEAPS to protect my entire portfolio. This helps to protect from market timing risk - when exactly is the right time to sell the LEAPS? If you have, say, four long-dated put options, laddered six months apart, you could set a strategy by which every six months you sell one and buy another. By doing this, you actually help protect portfolio gains in the ""danger zone"" - if you retire and your portfolio gains 15% the next year, your purchase a year into retirement of put options 15% below the market value is actually locking in your gains at your original retirement date value. 

3. As an example, SPY is currently at $283.xx. LEAPS at $250 for Jun 2020 (last trade price that I saw as of time of this post) are currently priced at $12.00. So for 22 months of protection at 88.1% of current portfolio value will cost approximately 4.2% of the portfolio, or approximately 2.29% of portfolio on an annual basis, if it stays completely flat.

4. If the market rises, this insurance policy -essentially what this is - deteriorates in value - but that is OK because your portfolio is rising. If the market stays flat, then it will also deteriorate, albeit at a slower rate. If the market falls, then the put does its job and helps emeliorate your losses and protect you in your vulnerable years.


Does anyone want to weigh in on this, shoot it full of holes, etc? Like I said, this is academic in my current situation, but it is an interesting problem to consider. 

I am also, for the record, not advocating for 100% equities in retirement if you own puts. But perhaps, instead of a 75/25 portfolio in the danger zone, one could do 85/15 and own some LEAPS, or something similar - I have not done the exhaustive math to map this out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of strategy in this sub pertaining to the use of bond tents and (somewhat) large allocations to bonds in the early years of retirement and the years leading up to retirement, with the goal of minimizing sequence of returns risk.

For a year, I have been committed to saving and am proud of how I adjusted my habits and expenses. From my 2000 Euro income, I manage to save 25% each month. 

However, there is one cost that would make a substantial impact: My rent. My workplace is in a very expensive city, and I spent a lot to live in a frankly shitty room. It's already a good deal with 750 Euro for the area, but still! 
Now, the possibility to go life in my home town (130km away) opened up now. This move would save me 500 euro (25% of my income!) every month.

Now I am pondering if I should ask my employer to work remotely, coming to the office 1-2 days per week. I know that some people in the company do it, albeit in very different positions.

Info:

Life situation: single, 27M, 100k salary in Bay Area, living at home.

Assets: 15k in Roth IRA, 15k in 401k split between traditional and Roth. Savings rate 16.5% with company match. 54k in brokerage accounts. $7k emergency fund, ~$3k checking. 

Liabilities: 5.5k car ($480/month), ~440k condo that is a rental owned with parents. 

Expenses: $480 for car, $500-$800 for food. 10k in a hobby that I could get out if needed.

I moved back to the bay area a few years ago and got a job in tech. I ended up buying a condo with my parents but it is now being rented. I am not in love with my job, but it is relatively stress free and pays well. I have also been able to take on more responsibilities and hope to get a promotion. The only issue with my job is I'm not sure how transferable it is-it took me about 6 months to find another job a few years ago.

I would rather not live at home but it is the most convenient and logical option given rents and commutes here. There is nothing keeping me in the bay area but I'd feel stupid leaving my current job for a lower salary and I'm not sure I could get the same salary in other cities. I had planned on going back to business school, but now that the opportunity costs are around $400k and I'm not sure what I'd do after, I've put that on hold. Is an MBA worth it for the salary increases at my current salary?

As a result, I am not sure what I should do next. 

Idea #1: Stay at current job, which is relatively stable, and continue to save money. I can conceivably save about 75% of my after tax income. 

Idea #2: Look for other job in different city to not live at home-probably NY or LA.

Idea #3: Go to business school 

Thanks for any advice

I've been part of this sub for the better part of this year now, and wanted to say thanks for all the info I've picked up shared over the past little while. It's been six months since I graduated college, and I've been thinking a lot about the path to FIRE. 

I'm a 23 year marketing grad from the suburbs of Toronto. I was hired out of school by a large eCom company based out of Canada. While I still live at home with my parents, I'm salaried, and work remotely. All my college loans have since been paid off. Other than the cost of running my small business, I really don't have any major recurring expenses. 

I've opened up an investment portfolio with my dad's help, and automatically contribute ~2/3rds of my salary towards it. [I'm currently split 60/40 between Fixed Income and Equities](https://i.imgur.com/EdicjKL.png), and I'm looking to re-evaluate that split later in the year. That gives me ~$1000/mo to play with, split between food, business expenses, and recreation. I really don't need more shit, and I'm trying to get that number down to $500-750.

I'm eyeing IRL job postings within my company, looking to transition to a physical marketing/advertising role in Toronto or Ottawa within the next year. My salary would double, and I'd finally have a reason to move out on my own. Having attended a college 10 minutes from my parents' house, I'm itching for that independence. 

Until then, I'm contributing to this portfolio, and trying to generate as much side income as possible. Also thinking about getting a second job in a more creative field. I've just found myself wondering if there's anything more substantial I could use the money towards-

Do I put a downpayment on a 1bdrm in a ski village and rent it out? Do I divert some of my investment capital into a few stocks I'd like to hold for the long term? Do I buy a 2018 Subaru WRX and chrome wrap it?

Well here's my list:

1. Video games.  Despite their status as a luxury good, I challenge you to find anything cheaper on a per-hour basis.  One $60 game can give thousands of hours of entertainment.  If you can't run the latest and greatest, check out GOG.com for classics that can run on newer systems. (I have no affiliation).

2. Sunday movies.  Sunday morning and early afternoon tickets are typically cheaper, and some theaters turn a blind eye when you walk in with outside coffee.  You're less snarky and the theater is nearly empty.  The perfect cheap date.

3. Hand crafts.  If you really want a cheap hobby, take up knitting or any number of crafts.  Yes, any hobby can get insanely expensive, but they don't need to be.  For knitting, get two needles, 1 ball of yarn and make a hat.  They're cheap and make great gifts.  Start now and you'll have time to make your entire Christmas list.  And people love getting things you've made for them.  Same goes for wood carving, leather work or candle making.  Start cheap, make gifts.

4. Expensive clothing.  Here's the trick: avoid fads and logos and buy basics. Nice pants and shirts can last years if you line dry them, and they'll hold their shape too.  If you divide the cost over several years, this is a more economical way to shop in the long run, makes you feel good, and look good too.   The trick is to do this sparingly.  One big shopping trip a year, or one item every few months is appropriate.  Stick to your budget. 

5. Netflix, and other subscriptions.  Ditch cable and get a few if these apps.  It's cheaper than cable and going out.

My wife and I both work full time jobs and are in grad school, and work a night job that supplies free housing.  If we don't take care of ourselves every so often the stress would be too much.  This is how we get by while meeting our goals.

There are of course limits to it as the gains add to your income which will eventually push you to the next bracket and it can impact things like Roth conversions and qualified dividends if you sell and re-buy at the wrong time.

I read that a caveat to it is if you live in a state with capital gains taxes it will drag down the efficiency of this, since you'd be paying state capital gains taxes each year and taking away money that would otherwise be compounding until you eventually sell longer term. To a certain extent this makes sense but it doesn't give a breakeven point to the state tax rate at which it no longer makes sense to tax gain harvest (probably because it depends on variable input). I couldn't find a calculator or example showing situations when you should or shouldn't use tax gain harvesting so I decided to simulate some examples. 

Results are dependent on fed tax rate, state tax rate, investment returns, and investment duration.
Note the below assumes a 5 year investment at 10% returns on 100k and you have not filled up your 12% income bracket with the gain harvesting.

Key findings:  
Higher investment return rates correlate to a lower state tax rate needed for breakeven, but this isn't very meaningful even at unrealistic 20% annual returns (breakeven ~10% state tax vs 15% fed tax).  
At a 15% fed tax rate, 3% state tax rate, and 10% annual returns (off principle of 100k), ~5k would be saved by tax gain harvesting over 5 years.  
At a 15% fed tax rate, 5% state tax rate, and 10% annual returns (off principle of 100k), ~4k would be saved by tax gain harvesting over 5 years.  
At a 15% fed tax rate, 7% state tax rate, and 10% annual returns (off principle of 100k), ~3k would be saved by tax gain harvesting over 5 years.

Hopefully this gives some perspective on if tax gain harvesting may benefit you. I realized that it won't be super useful to me until I build up taxable accounts and by then I likely won't be in the 12% bracket.

I know there are a lot of different ways to get to FI but from blogs, podcasts and here, one theme that always seems to blow my mind is when people talk about their savings rate? How do some people have a savings rate of 50% or more? To me that seems damn near impossible to hit. From my calculations, in my best month I’ve only been able to hit around 30% but most months I’m in the 10-15% range. How do people calculate their savings rate? Is it based off gross or net income? Is their savings mostly automated so it comes out of their paychecks/bank accounts immediately? Or do people just have a crazy high income where they can save 50% or more and still have a life?

For me to hit the 50% mark, depending on whether it’s calculated off of gross or net I would have to save an additional $1,100-1,800 more a month.  I make $56,000. I have roommates and live in a relatively low cost of living city. I know I probably spend too much on going out/eating out each month and would also save more if I didn’t pay for my GF so often (not an argument worth having every time I go out).

By all means, I should be proud of my ability to accomplish this feat. I make a modest $50k and live in a large US city. Yet I feel tired and bored all the time.

Since then, I have relatively been treating myself to not always the cheapest menu item when I eat out and heck, I even bought a new pair of shoes!

I live in a Brooklyn, NY with my wife and two year old baby in a 1 bed 1 bath co-op.  I've  been looking to buy a 2 bed 2 bath apartment in my neighborhood. It's pretty expensive and I can't afford to pay $650k-$800k right now. 

My next door neighbor recently decided to move and wanted to know if I wanted to buy his 1 bed 1 bath so I can combine apartments to get the 2 bed 2 bath I was looking for. He's asking around $350k (less with an all cash offer). I like my building and my neighbors. The problem is that the building's monthly maintenance is pretty high: around $800. If I bought his apartment, my monthly maintenance would double to $1,600. I would also have to hire a contractor to remove walls and combine the two apartments together.

My baby wouldn't want her own bedroom now, but will in 7-8 years or so. If I buy now, I would pay in cash and use up all my non-retirement savings but I can secure the apartment size I want for the future. I really have no need for the extra bedroom now. I have no debt and I currently own my apartment.

What's more important? Buy an apartment I want for the future or continue saving for future FIRE and buy later when I have more cash savings?

Thanks. Please let me know if I left out any important information.

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for taking the time to read and reply to my post. I can't talk to any of my friend about this. They don't understand FIRE. A good friend at work yesterday asked me what size my TV was at home. I said, I don't know....48"" maybe? For some reason, he couldn't believe it.

After reading around for a while on all of them I think the people in this sub will be able to best answer my question with real world experiences. Also, I apologize in advance for the long winded post.

Some Background:

Graduated Spring 2015 with BS in Mechanical Engineering with \~$103k in student loan debt. I really drank the Kool Aid that the counselors were dishing out about going to the best school I could get into. Had good enough grades to get into a respected school but was apparently not good enough to get some nice scholarships. Got a job right out of school paying $62k which was bumped to $68k within the first 6 months. During this time I was renting a place with a few friends. In 2017 I took a new job at $81k which was also very close to my parents. After talking with them I decided to move back in with them to allow me to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible.

Current Situation:

I am on track to make my last student loan payment this December. My parents have said that I can continue to live with them rent-free for as long as I need in order to save money for a down payment on a house. We get along fine but the issue is that my hobbies/lifestyle don’t work well with this situation. I race dirt bikes and enjoy woodworking. Currently I have to move tons of stuff in the garage multiple times a week to get to my tools so that I can work on my bike (and then move all the stuff back when I am done) and the few powertools that I do have for woodworking are tucked away in the basement and are not usable due to how much other stuff is stored down there (I love my parents, but they are pretty bad packrats. lol).

Financial Stats:

26 year old single guy

Salary: $81k base + 10% yearly bonus

401k: $33k currently (5% contribution from me + additional 8% from employer)

Truck Payment/Insurance: $770/mo (includes insurance on truck and 2 motorcycles, thanks MI for screwing everyone on insurance premiums...)

Student Loans: \~$17k currently, throwing \~$3150/mo at this to kill these ASAP

Groceries: \~$200/mo (meal prep almost everything, rarely eat out)

Gas: \~$200/mo

Dirt Bike Racing: \~$200/mo (fuel, entry fees, parts, etc)

Gym Membership: \~$20/mo

Finally, on to the actual question. As mentioned above, my current situation does not provide enough space for my lifestyle. I have been looking around for the last year or so to see if I can find anything that I would consider buying, but have not seen a single place that fits the bill.

My requirements are:

Land Size: 5 acres minimum

House: Single floor, modern industrial styling, open floor plan, \~1500-2000 sq ft

Garage/Workshop: &gt;1000 sq ft

I have found a few places that meet my land size requirement but the house would need a complete remodel to match my tastes and they have been fairly old and at a minimum would require some updating. This is leading me towards the route of building something. One thing I have going in my favor budget-wise is that I have no desire to be near a city, so I can look at cheaper land in “the-middle-of-nowhere” as long as it is reasonably close to an expressway so I can get to work in a decent amount of time. I have found some land that I like in the $60-80k range (looking in MI in Oakland, Livingston, and Washtenaw counties). I have \~$8k stashed right now and will contribute \~$3150/mo (money that was going to student loans) to this account starting in Jan. Am I crazy for thinking this I is something that I can realistically start next year? Does anyone have any experience with the FHA Construction-to-Permanent mortgage? I know that paying PMI is not ideal, but I am trying to look at this in the “build the life you want, then save for it” mindset. This would be a huge increase in long term satisfaction for me and accomplish a huge goal of mine as I have been dreaming of owning a large piece of property with my own shop for as long as I can remember. I have a feeling the answer is not going to be what I want to hear but I am starting to go a little crazy with my current situation and am hoping that someone will be able to give me some advice on a way to make this happen.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This post could probably fit into &lt;a href=""/r/personalfinance""&gt;r/personalfinance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/r/RealEstate""&gt;r/RealEstate&lt;/a&gt;, and here.

When I read through all these chats and various blogs it's apparent that investing has a ton of components to it and can be very complicated. The sky is truly the limit. And I appreciate people that can understand all those things and strive to squeeze out every penny they can.

The biggest factor in my wife and I hitting our FI in our early 40's was not some clever high tech investment strategy. Rather it was just getting started early.

I was horrible with money when I was younger... did not have good role models when it came to saving or managing finances. Then started a business and you can imagine how that worked out. After getting deep in consumer and business debt, and clawing our way out of it over a few tough years, I vowed to live within our means and save aggressively while working toward FI, but not at the expense of having a life. 

Instead of scrutinizing every small expense, I worked (and still work) on the income side. I work hard to grow our business that provides for our family and allows us to save pretty aggressively. I also do consulting which brings in a substantial side income, and use that for additional savings, charitable giving, and play money (like building a wine cellar in my basement and outfitting my woodworking shop). 

I don't think twice about taking my wife out to an expensive restaurant or buying nice clothes (though I make sure they're on sale because I know the markup being in the apparel industry). At this point I've pissed millions of dollars in long-term gains down the drain anyway from my mistakes in my early years, I'm not going to eat ramen noodles now so I can have an extra few bucks when I'm 55 or 60.

I want financial independence not because I want to quit working, but so I can decide what I want to do and when without ever worrying about the financial ramifications. I love what I do (entrepreneur) and will probably work until the day I die, so maybe that's the difference? 

I'm curious what you guys think about this - anyone else not super frugal but working toward FI? Anyone else rather work their butt of increasing their income than scrutinizing every penny that goes out month to month?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious, do you guys ever think of working on the income side of the equation more than the expenses side?

&lt;p&gt;Was reading a recent thread by a guy that finally treated himself to a couple of drinks after saving 50% of his income for 3 years. A couple of drinks!!&lt;/p&gt;

I have read both sides of the pay off your mortgage early vs investing that money debate and both sides have some good points. I am the type of guy that is always chasing an option C. So my question is what are your thoughts on doing a bit of both?

If I pay off 1/2 the mortgage it cuts my 30 year down to 13 and most of the mortgage payment is equity instead of interest. That helps these payments turn into a forced savings account instead of lost money.

It would also leave me with a good chuck of change to keep investing with.

The only down side that I can see is I don't get rid of the monthly mortgage payment. Anything I am missing. Am I crazy and should I stick with A or B?

Not a native, please be gentle with my spelling. I am a 30 yo (m) german manufacturing engineer. Currently, I live with my SO in a High Cost-of-Living area in germany and have a union contract that pays pretty well, considering the hours I work. 

Here is my current situation:

Union (IG Metall) Benefits include:

* 30 days paid vacation
* Health insurance paid
* Retirement insurance (basic + company premium)
* 40 hours of work (clocking, time account)

Gross base yearly income: 63k EUR 

Performance Bonus (usually around 20%): 12.6k EUR

**Total Gross Income: 75k EUR**

**Net Income: 45k EUR**

Total spending: 20k EUR

*Saving: 25k EUR*

I am generally interested in FI but this could be a major shortcut, however here are the two roads I can go down.

# #1 Expat in Shanghai for 15 month (within the company)

* All working hours are compensated with salary (Base: 40 hours, probably 50-60)
* my SO just started a new Job, so she'd stay in my old appartment and visits me twice for vacation
   * we have done this twice but only for half a year each.
* Location: Jiading, Shanghai
* Not a managing position, manufacturing engineering team
* job is much less enjoyable than the one I have, which I really like
   * No budgetary power
   * More day-to-day work, less strategical
   * No clear description of the  job
   * More demanding targets (that I set myself, but also from my manager) even though there is no variable       payout everything is fixed)
* I have lived in Shanghai for about half a year in 2013

**Total Net income: 99k EUR (including all allowances, paid out) --&gt; Salary Position in the contract is net!**

Housing budget: 220k CNY (19k CNY/month)

Spending is hard to predict (HCL, commute, no car, etc.), but I try to live a quite frugal lifestyle (work, eat chinese, go climibing, visit asia): 35-40 %

Expenses in Germany (appartment, insurances, Support SO, etc): 20k EUR 

Saving: ca. 50k EUR (total 15 month)

When I come back I get my old job back (by contract)

I think 60/40 allocation of VTSAX and VTIAX Admiral Shares is generally all I need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help!&lt;/p&gt;

Because I am a bit older than some on this sub I feel confident that social security will pay out at least 80% of what it currently does so that is what goes into my assumptions.  I am 50 and my wife is 3 years younger than me. We both plan to start collecting SS at age 67.  
  
One of my many spreadsheets is a forecast sheet with 1 row per year and with various assumptions on inflation, market returns, savings, living expenses etc.  Looking at the numbers over and over I felt like saving up 25x my forecasted expenses before I retired was way too conservative but couldn't figure out how to model something else.  Today I realized that because I am older, I don't need my initial savings to last me for 30+ years.  Part of it needs to last until I can start drawing on my IRA, part of it needs to last until I start collecting SS, part of it needs to last until my wife starts collecting SS, and the rest needs to last for ~20 years beyond that.  
  
So now I have 3 numbers:  
FIRE#1 = 21x expenses in ~2022 when I can stop earning an income.  
FIRE#2 = 25x expenses *less SS for me* in ~2036 when I start collecting SS.  
FIRE#3 = 30x expenses *less SS for my wife and I* in ~2039 when my wife starts collecting SS.
  
There is no guarantee that both of us will live until 67 and I don't want one of us dying to mess up the other one's financial future.  If I fail to reach FIRE#1 by 2022, that amount *reduces to 20.5x* because I don't need the money to last as long now!

&lt;p&gt;I have a side business that I&amp;#39;d like to start, in order to have something useful to do (rather than fuck off on the web) during the face time. I&amp;#39;m sure that a lot of people have done this. What were your strategies? How&amp;#39;d you avoid getting caught? What worked, and what didn&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what can be taken away IP-wise if you get caught doing it &amp;quot;on company time&amp;quot;? I wouldn&amp;#39;t write production code on an employer&amp;#39;s resources– in part because offices are a terrible place for deep work anyway– but what about promotional materials, correspondence, etc.? In the outlier event of getting caught, do they ever take that, just to be dicks?&lt;/p&gt;

I came across this section of Reddit not too long ago. I'm awestruck by the quality of discussions here. I present a narrative of a person who I dearly loved. He had pledged allegiance to financial independence at a young age. Also, I must mention that English isn't my native language. My apologies if there are errors.


5 years ago a person dear to me departed for the divine abode. He was 54 years old. Before I share the cause for deterioration of his being, I deem it appropriate to share a succinct description of his life.

He was my mother's first cousin. Despite the seemingly distant relationship our ties were exceedingly healthy. He didn't have a blood sister. Hence, he adored my mother. He was a fine man. Refined , cultivated, considerate and benevolent would be his major characteristics.

He was born in a middle class family. His performance in academics had been exemplary since middle school. He pursued a bachelor's degree in commerce and prepared for the laborious course of Chartered Accountancy.

His determination paid him rich dividends. He passed both the courses with flying colours.
On being granted his degree certificate he secured a job as an equity analyst at a leading reinsurance company.

Slowly yet steadily he ascended the corporate ladder. He got involved in a conjugal relationship at the age of 29. Two years later they were blessed with a baby girl.

He was a human par excellence. But, he did have some flaws. He was a miserly person.
His disinclination to spend often led to friction in his household. He despised visiting restaurants , detested intercity travelling and abhorred acquisition of materials.


 He enjoyed living a spartan life. His was a life not distinct from an ascetic. He was a corporate ascetic. But, it's crucial to note that he was a kind soul. Anytime someone sought help for urgent, important matters he would offer wholehearted support - Monetary and Emotional. 



All this while he was growing at a pace in his company that could generate envy in others.
Time passes swiftly. His daughter graduated with a degree in commerce. He encouraged her to pursue Chartered Accountancy.


 But, she was desirous of pursuing a career in hospitality. He was displeased but didn't prove to be an impediment in her journey.


In the years that passed he had made a fortune. It was enough money to last 2 lifetimes. Now in his late 40s he realised that he hadn't spent as much time as he should have with his family and friends.

He would often pacify his wife by asserting that they would embark on a world tour post his retirement which was just 8 years away. He yearned to settle in close proximity of the hills. Away from the din, pollution and chaos of urban areas.
But, that was not to be.


Without delving in the details I'll share that on turning 53 years old his life was ruined when doctors revealed he was patient of cirrhosis.


 This was a person who hadn't ever consumed alcohol or smoked cigarettes.
We were devastated. It was a heart rending revelation.



Doctors shared that a liver transplant could help him. But, they weren't confident.
But my uncle was keen to survive, to thrive. He had many, many unfulfilled desires.
Fiscally he was comfortably placed and could afford a transplant by taking some difficult decisions. 



Those who are aware of the procedure for transplant operations will know that waiting lists are excruciatingly long. After a waiting period of 8 months, thanks to the Almighty's grace he was presented with an opportunity to undergo the surgery.


Those who occupied higher slots in the waiting list refused to accept the organ. My uncle was exultant. His hopes rose. Once again he began to harbour a desire to live.




The operation was performed by an illustrious hepatologist. Those were distressing times. 
The surgery concluded. We were emphatically told that it was a success. But, his condition continued to worsen in the hospital.


 Day after day, his health decayed. After 10 days of admittance in the hospital he gave up on life. He departed for a higher journey.

Doctors informed us impassively. Squeals, cried pierced the waiting room. Tears rolled down our cheeks. We were filled with indignation.



He passed away at 54. He didn't enjoy his life. He denied himself an opportunity to enjoy. His dream of visiting countries around the globe was left unfulfilled. And so was his hope of residing in a rural area. 



He delayed attainment of pleasure. He lived for tomorrow. But, the tomorrow he survived for didn't come.



The objective of this post isn't to glorify a life devoid of planning. It's essential to plan for tomorrow and live an organised life. But, it happens frequently that in the fond hope of relishing our future we ruin our present. 



We nurse a misplaced belief that there's quite some time before the stoppage of our existence. But, we never know.


This very moment could be my last for all I know. I wish all of you a long and healthy life. 
But I'd like to humbly submit that all we have is NOW. NO ONE GUARANTEES OUR TOMORROW.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear readers, 
I came across this section of Reddit not too long ago. I&amp;#39;m awestruck by the quality of discussions here. I present a narrative of a person who I dearly loved. He had pledged allegiance to financial independence at a young age. Also, I must mention that English isn&amp;#39;t my native language. My apologies if there are errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 years ago a person dear to me departed for the divine abode. He was 54 years old. Before I share the cause for deterioration of his being, I deem it appropriate to share a succinct description of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was my mother&amp;#39;s first cousin. Despite the seemingly distant relationship our ties were exceedingly healthy. He didn&amp;#39;t have a blood sister. Hence, he adored my mother. He was a fine man. Refined , cultivated, considerate and benevolent would be his major characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was born in a middle class family. His performance in academics had been exemplary since middle school. He pursued a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in commerce and prepared for the laborious course of Chartered Accountancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His determination paid him rich dividends. He passed both the courses with flying colours.
On being granted his degree certificate he secured a job as an equity analyst at a leading reinsurance company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly yet steadily he ascended the corporate ladder. He got involved in a conjugal relationship at the age of 29. Two years later they were blessed with a baby girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a human par excellence. But, he did have some flaws. He was a miserly person.
His disinclination to spend often led to friction in his household. He despised visiting restaurants , detested intercity travelling and abhorred acquisition of materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He enjoyed living a spartan life. His was a life not distinct from an ascetic. He was a corporate ascetic. But, it&amp;#39;s crucial to note that he was a kind soul. Anytime someone sought help for urgent, important matters he would offer wholehearted support - Monetary and Emotional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this while he was growing at a pace in his company that could generate envy in others.
Time passes swiftly. His daughter graduated with a degree in commerce. He encouraged her to pursue Chartered Accountancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, she was desirous of pursuing a career in hospitality. He was displeased but didn&amp;#39;t prove to be an impediment in her journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years that passed he had made a fortune. It was enough money to last 2 lifetimes. Now in his late 40s he realised that he hadn&amp;#39;t spent as much time as he should have with his family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

I was already strongly leaning toward accepting the new job, but I'm now convinced more than ever that it's the right move.  Sometimes it's easy to miss the forest for the trees.  I'm going to let my supervisor know that I will not be accepting their counter-offer.

This post may be better suited to r/sysadmin, but I wanted to get some perspective from the people in this sub.  Here's a quick background:  I'm 30, married, living in the Pacific Northwest (born and raised), and an I.T. professional with 8+ years of experience.

After 5 years of working for the same ownership group and management team, I never once asked for a raise or used a single day of vacation.  Instead, I used only our allotted PTO days (5 per year) during that time.  We're given only 5 paid federal holidays per year as it's essentially a 24/7 business operation that is open all but 2 days in the entire year.  For roughly half of my tenure I've been required to be on-call for emergency after-hours technical support without any additional compensation.  I never received a monthly cell phone plan stipend (after inquiring multiple times in the past) despite being required to use my personal cell phone for work purposes,  Meanwhile, co-workers in my department and other employees throughout the organization all receive a stipend for using their personal devices for business if they are not assigned a company-issued phone.    


A few years ago after shockingly losing one of my closest relatives to suicide, I was informed that the company's bereavement policy only covered immediate family members and that I would need to use my own PTO or vacation days to take that time off to be with my family and attend his funeral.  For years I consistently stayed late in the office (voluntarily) to help meet project deadlines and keep us afloat of our daily workload because we were so heavily understaffed.  I've always taken the initiative to fix issues and make improvements wherever possible, and continuously asked to undertake additional responsibilities.  I've also consistently found ways to save our organization tens of thousands of dollars per year or more in software licensing, training, and hardware procurement costs.  While my skills, abilities and job duties have significantly increased over the last two and a half years, I've only received a single 3% cost-of-living salary increase during that time (one year ago).  I've essentially assumed the role of a System Administrator during this span, but my title has remained Desktop Support Technician along with the much lesser salary (and job requirements) that come with it.  I've been extremely flexible with my time and schedule and have traveled anywhere (we have 12 locations throughout the Pacific Northwest) they have asked me to be at any time (sometimes with less than 24 hour notice), including once 3 days before Christmas where I ended up getting stuck on a highway in a blizzard.  There have been countless times where I've worked extended hours (12+) in one day (again, voluntarily) to help resolve issues, and yet if for example I had to leave 30 minutes early the following day to go to a medical appointment, my supervisor would often expect me to ""make up"" that time so that I would need to stay an additional 30 minutes the next day, completely discounting all of the extra work I had done in the previous days/weeks.  

A few weeks ago, I asked my supervisor if it would be possible to earn more pay for more work.  Not a raise and not a demand, but simply a request to receive more pay for more of my time and availability.  Weeks passed and I felt that there was no real sense of urgency or desire to make anything happen right away.  So I finally decided that enough was enough and it was time to start looking for other jobs for the first time in more than 5 years.  Within a week I received and accepted an offer at a non-profit hospital for a System Administrator position.  It comes with a $6,000 salary raise, 2 weeks of paid vacation, 11 paid federal holidays plus 1 floating holiday, and 96 hours of paid sick leave per year (I have 3 weeks paid vacation, 5 paid holidays, 0 paid sick leave, 5 PTO days).  They offer a full 5% employer match/contribution to the 403(b) company retirement plan (compared to the 3% at my current job), the health insurance premiums are $103 less per month and their annual maximum deductible is only $700 per year ($2,700 at current employer), saving me at least $3,250 annually.  I wouldn't have access to an HSA anymore, but that's alright.  The other main draw of the new job is that they're not open 24/7.  No nights, weekend or holiday support required.  I would never be on-call again and I would not be providing help desk support which I've come to grow extremely tired of.  

I told my supervisor the next day and I was very forthright and honest with him:  I was leaving, and I was leaving because I wanted (and deserved/earned) a promotion and significant raise.  I also voiced my frustration and disdain for being on-call without adequate compensation, as well as being expected to hold down the responsibilities of two jobs for the pay of one.  I stated I felt that I was grossly underpaid and he agreed.  I also mentioned the unfairness with the cell phone stipend deal and the inflexibility I'm afforded because of my additional help desk role relative to my peers that are not working in support who have no such restrictions and have much more freedom and autonomy.  He mostly agreed with that as well and apologized for not giving me the cell stipend.  They strongly expressed their desire to retain me.  After speaking with the owner, they finally provided me with a counter-offer yesterday:  a promotion to System Administrator, $10,000 base salary increase, $30/month cell phone stipend, $50 for every week I'm on-call, and a $5,000 project/performance-based annual incentive bonus.  Not including the bonus, the total compensation (including salary, benefits, monetary value of time off) are almost exactly the same and up to $5,000 more assuming I earn the bonus.  I would still be expected to provide help desk support as well.  It's certainly an improvement from what I was receiving before, but I still don't quite feel like it's adequate.  Particularly the $50/week on-call payment.  That's really not very much to potentially have to work a lot more at any time, as well as the loss of freedom and flexibility in my personal life.

I'm strongly leaning toward going to the other organization due to the more normal business operation hours, the extra time off, not having to work in a Tier 1 support role, never having to worry about being on-call or systems going down after-hours, a more affordable health plan, superior benefits, and just having a fresh start in a new environment.  It seems like the obvious choice, but I wanted to get other opinions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and recommendations.

Here&amp;#39;s a quick background:  I&amp;#39;m 30, married, living in the Pacific Northwest (born and raised), and an I.T. professional with 8+ years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 5 years of working for the same ownership group and management team, I never once asked for a raise or used a single day of vacation.  Instead, I used only our allotted PTO days (5 per year) during that time.  We&amp;#39;re given only 5 paid federal holidays per year as it&amp;#39;s essentially a 24/7 business operation that is open all but 2 days in the entire year.  For roughly half of my tenure I&amp;#39;ve been required to be on-call for emergency after-hours technical support without any additional compensation.  I never received a monthly cell phone plan stipend (after inquiring multiple times in the past) despite being required to use my personal cell phone for work purposes,  Meanwhile, co-workers in my department and other employees throughout the organization all receive a stipend for using their personal devices for business if they are not assigned a company-issued phone.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago after shockingly losing one of my closest relatives to suicide, I was informed that the company&amp;#39;s bereavement policy only covered immediate family members and that I would need to use my own PTO or vacation days to take that time off to be with my family and attend his funeral.  For years I consistently stayed late in the office (voluntarily) to help meet project deadlines and keep us afloat of our daily workload because we were so heavily understaffed.  I&amp;#39;ve always taken the initiative to fix issues and make improvements wherever possible, and continuously asked to undertake additional responsibilities.  I&amp;#39;ve also consistently found ways to save our organization tens of thousands of dollars per year or more in software licensing, training, and hardware procurement costs.  While my skills, abilities and job duties have significantly increased over the last two and a half years, I&amp;#39;ve only received a single 3% cost-of-living salary increase during that time (one year ago).  I&amp;#39;ve essentially assumed the role of a System Administrator during this span, but my title has remained Desktop Support Technician along with the much lesser salary (and job requirements) that come with it.  I&amp;#39;ve been extremely flexible with my time and schedule and have traveled anywhere (we have 12 locations throughout the Pacific Northwest) they have asked me to be at any time (sometimes with less than 24 hour notice), including once 3 days before Christmas where I ended up getting stuck on a highway in a blizzard.  There have been countless times where I&amp;#39;ve worked extended hours (12+) in one day (again, voluntarily) to help resolve issues, and yet if for example I had to leave 30 minutes early the following day to go to a medical appointment, my supervisor would often expect me to &amp;quot;make up&amp;quot; that time so that I would need to stay an additional 30 minutes the next day, completely discounting all of the extra work I had done in the previous days/weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I asked my supervisor if it would be possible to earn more pay for more work.  Not a raise and not a demand, but simply a request to receive more pay for more of my time and availability.  Weeks passed and I felt that there was no real sense of urgency or desire to make anything happen right away.  So I finally decided that enough was enough and it was time to start looking for other jobs for the first time in more than 5 years.  Within a week I received and accepted an offer at a non-profit hospital for a System Administrator position.  It comes with a $6,000 salary raise, 2 weeks of paid vacation, 11 paid federal holidays plus 1 floating holiday, and 96 hours of paid sick leave per year (I have 3 weeks paid vacation, 5 paid holidays, 0 paid sick leave, 5 PTO days).  They offer a full 5% employer match/contribution to the 403(b) company retirement plan (compared to the 3% at my current job), the health insurance premiums are $103 less per month and their annual maximum deductible is only $700 per year ($2,700 at current employer), saving me at least $3,250 annually.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t have access to an HSA anymore, but that&amp;#39;s alright.  The other main draw of the new job is that they&amp;#39;re not open 24/7.  No nights, weekend or holiday support required.  I would never be on-call again and I would not be providing help desk support which I&amp;#39;ve come to grow extremely tired of.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my supervisor the next day and I was very forthright and honest with him:  I was leaving, and I was leaving because I wanted (and deserved/earned) a promotion and significant raise.  I also voiced my frustration and disdain for being on-call without adequate compensation, as well as being expected to hold down the responsibilities of two jobs for the pay of one.  I stated I felt that I was grossly underpaid and he agreed.  I also mentioned the unfairness with the cell phone stipend deal and the inflexibility I&amp;#39;m afforded because of my additional help desk role relative to my peers that are not working in support who have no such restrictions and have much more freedom and autonomy.  He mostly agreed with that as well and apologized for not giving me the cell stipend.  They strongly expressed their desire to retain me.  After speaking with the owner, they finally provided me with a counter-offer yesterday:  a promotion to System Administrator, $10,000 base salary increase, $30/month cell phone stipend, $50 for every week I&amp;#39;m on-call, and a $5,000 project/performance-based annual incentive bonus.  Not including the bonus, the total compensation (including salary, benefits, monetary value of time off) are almost exactly the same and up to $5,000 more assuming I earn the bonus.  I would still be expected to provide help desk support as well.  It&amp;#39;s certainly an improvement from what I was receiving before, but I still don&amp;#39;t quite feel like it&amp;#39;s adequate.  Particularly the $50/week on-call payment.  That&amp;#39;s really not very much to potentially have to work a lot more at any time, as well as the loss of freedom and flexibility in my personal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m strongly leaning toward going to the other organization due to the more normal business operation hours, the extra time off, not having to work in a Tier 1 support role, never having to worry about being on-call or systems going down after-hours, a more affordable health plan, superior benefits, and just having a fresh start in a new environment.  It seems like the obvious choice, but I wanted to get other opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I have been on the path to FI for a while now but without ever setting a fixed target.
I've always found calculating a fixed target quite difficult in our case and can't seem to quite get through it.

How would you calculate how much money is needed taking the following into account?

- We live in Europe, so will receive a pension starting age ~65-68 (I've worked in 3 countries so it differs)
- We have multiple pension savings accounts from employers, some of which will be paid as a lump sum at age ~60, some of which will be paid out over a period of 5-10 years starting earliest at age 55. One of these plans receives monthly contributions and is thus growing.
- We have personal investments and savings and are growing these actively
- We will receive multiple inheritances in the future, of unknown value. Also, these aren't really something I want to take into account as they are unknown, but it would mean an additional lump sum

The way I've tried to get through it is to divide life in 3 buckets.
The bucket following pension age, the bucket of 55 till pension age, and the bucket of whenever we can/want to retire till 55. And then calculate what is needed for each bucket. But this approach doesn't fill me with a lot of confidence that it's even remotely correct.

Thanks for your insights on how to approach this calculation!

I highly recommend it!

The overarching premise of the book is that there are many people out there who are reasonably wealthy (i.e. millionaires), but who do not exhibit the stereotypical signs of wealth (big house, flashy car, clothes, jewelry, other typical signs of living beyond one's means). This main point is likely something that most readers of this sub already get. But the book is still very worthwhile even without the premise constituting a revelation to the reader.

The book got me thinking: What would the country, or the world, look like with significantly-less consumer consumption? Surely, this is the hallmark if the FIRE community. Would it mean significant job losses in the sectors producing those consumer goods? Would it encourage investment into new sectors? Would people be freed up to simply not work as much?

The book studies the many differences between those who are wealthy and those who are not, highlighting the characteristics shared by modestly-wealthy millionaires - the heroes of the book - and lacking by their prodigal neighbors. 

I made note of several items that I thought were of particular interest to me:

* The authors use a good analogy of how, in order to become wealthy, one must play both good financial offense and good financial defense; in other words, it's great if you're out earning a bunch of money (i.e. good financial offense); but if you're not keeping that money around (financial defense), you probably will still lose the game in spite of your great earning abilities.  

* ""Income tax is the single largest annual expenditure for most households."" Clearly, many people would do well to figure out how to reduce that expense.  

* Among adults who still receive significant periodic cash gifts from parents (the authors call this ""economic outpatient care""), two thirds of such recipients consider themselves as members of the ""I did it on my own"" club. In other words, to use another sports analogy, there are lots of people who were born on third base and think they hit a triple.  

* The authors hit the issue of ""economic outpatient care"" several times, and I agree with the authors' conclusion that giving money to one's adult children ultimately causes them to become worse-off financially overall.  
 
* Pay yourself first, and automate it - take a chunk of income completely out of the equation without it being a periodic decision. Then, budget out what you must spend of the balance. If there is something left over (and there should be), save THAT too! Yes, I know this is like FIRE 101. But can we belabor this point too much?  

* A prodigal spouse = a low-wealth family - you won't accumulate wealth very easily if just one spouse is frugal

One criticism levied at the book was that it demonstrated survivorship bias - the authors focused on people who were actually millionaires, and not the people who had ""died trying."" I think that criticism is misplaced. If you look at NBA players and see that the average height is 6' 7"", and that 94% of the players are at least 6 feet tall, and the average height of all men is 5' 9"", you'd be wrong to conclude that tall height is a predictor of success (because we know that the vast majority of tall men are **not** in the NBA and **not** particularly good at basketball), but it would be reasonable to conclude that tall height seems to be an important trait of successful basketball players and that it seems less likely that you could become a successful basketball player if your height was under that threshold. In other words, tall height is a likely-necessary, but not at all sufficient, condition.

\*\*Situation:\*\* 32 yo, married DINKS, no debt, HCOL city apartment rental (by choice), 1 car, $400K combined NW, 28% SR in HCOL city, expected to jump to 35%-40% with RV living. Wife works remote from home (secure job, with company 8 years).  We are keeping both of our current jobs.  No kids expected for 3-4 years. Financing RV &amp; the truck to pull it (trading in car), monthly truck/RV loan payments will equal \~1/4 of our current rent in HCOL city. I work outside of the city so my commute will be cut in half by staying in campgrounds/RV parks near work. Campground fees will be anywhere between 1/6 to 1/4 our current apartment rent. Full time RVing is our FI dream, why not start now?

Projected expenses in RV life:

\* Health insurance (unchanged)

\* Truck/RV insurance (will double)

\* Gas will increase for work commute (it's a big truck), but we don't plan on traveling much (yet)

\* Apartment Rent, Utilities &amp; Comcast bill (will go to zero. Somewhat offset by RV/truck payments, campground fees, I estimate these to total 1/2 of our current rent (25% loan payments, 25% campground fees).

\* Internet $0, wife has phone with unlimited data with hotspot paid for by work so no more shitty Comcast!!)

\* Food budget (unchanged)

\* Storage unit fees ($65 a month, negligible)

Thoughts? Any other full timers out there either FI/RE'd or chasing FI/RE? 

EDIT: My wife and I did a 2 week, 4000 mile test drive of ""RV life"" in a rental in June and we LOVED IT. Expenses were obviously much higher because of the miles driven. Starting next month we aren't planning on driving the rig much other than between campgrounds every 2-3 weeks. The rental gave us a good idea of what we're getting into. Our 33' rig will get us into 85% of national &amp; state parks. Between Nov &amp; April we probably wont drive the rig at all since we'll be staying at a year round campground with winter hookups.

EDIT #2: We've visited the two main campgrounds we'll be staying at and both have cell service, a little store, and wifi on spot. They are also within 2-3 miles of civilization (walmart/costco/restaurants/Starbucks/etc). 

EDIT #3: RV repairs ARE going to be an issue, I realize this. Even with a new rig things break all the time. We've decided to buy new so we'll at least have the ""bumper to bumper"" warranty so to speak from a very reputable manufacturer, but I also plan on learning how to repair as many things as I can myself before taking it in to the dealership.

My issue is that my savings rate tends to drop after a month or so of ""peak enthusiasm"".

Most of my friends and my spouse aren't that into it, and knowing that despite all optimization I still have about 10 years of career ahead of me, I begin to feel a bit... worn out? MMM is great for inspiration, but he posts very infrequently these days.

How do you do it - any tips on keeping the ""spark"" alive? Or is it easy for you? Did you manage to turn on the autopilot so that you don't even think about it anymore?

1. Are there any ""gotchas"" or downsides to it? I mean, is it possible you sell your ETFs/mutual funds, and when you go to buy them back they have jumped up significantly? Are there are unintended consequences I should know about? Is there a way to screw it up?

2. What is the best way to do it? On your own online? Go to your broker? My broker is Schwab.

3. Our investments went in about a year ago, in July, so most of what we bought is now just over a year old. Is it OK to do tax gain harvesting in the middle of the year, or should it be at the end of the year?

4. How does it affect things if I bought more shares of one of the ETFs in about March? 

5. Can you only do tax gain harvesting in a brokerage account, or can you do it within retirement accounts as well? (Although maybe this doesn't make any sense in a tax-deferred account, since you cannot pay any taxes on gains in that account until you withdraw it...but maybe in Roth accounts it does work? Figured I'd just ask about this issue anyway).

6. This and the next question are related to the idea that I want to tax harvest only up to my 0% tax space. For a married couple that is currently $77k/year, correct? So am I right in assuming that our 2018 income for establishing what our tax bracket is will be: earnings + bank interest + stock dividends **MINUS** 403b contribution, 457b contribution and traditional IRA contributions? (our MAGI should be $101k or less after we deduct 403bs and 457bs, so I believe our tIRAs *are* fully deductible). 

7. Because 40% or so of my income is freelance, I don't know quite what our total 2018 income will be until the end of the year. So I don't know how much room we have for tax gain harvesting. That is, if I make more money, we will have more income and so I can't harvest as much. How should I deal with this? Should I do wait until the end of the year, or should I harvest some now? Or...?

**Let's share our progress and plans here. I'll start.**

I'm a (pushing-) 24-year-old Malaysian living in a small city. Graduated a year ago with no stable job yet. No student debts thanks to sidejobs and frugal-living during college. Still learning about finance slowly since we severely lack resources to learn about these things.


**Current progress (if you can call it that)**

I'm currently working as a substitute teacher, salary is about RM54 per day (~$12). The salary used to be RM100 (~$24) per day for my level of qualification (undergrad) but the previous government went into so much debt that every sub teacher got paid by highschool qualification, regardless of their real qualification.

Since college, I also do freelance work, which pays anywhere between RM500 to RM2000 (~$120 to ~$470) per job. I usually get one job every one or two months.  Our country's financial condition is improving since the thieves are no longer in power but at 24, I think I should have more than RM5K in my savings.


**Spendings**

I'm a rather frugal person, many of my clothes are years old (not rags though). Not really into gadgets, eating out etc. Only guarantee spendings are:

Jiujitsu classes (~RM200 monthly)

Guitar maintenance (RM100/- yearly)

Books (RM150/- yearly)

Steam sales (RM100/- yearly)

Internet plans (RM50/- monthly)

Other hobbies are mostly free (drawing, etc)


**Plans**

I'm going to grad school this September, but one half of the motivation to do so is to be in the capital city to look for more job opportunities. The plan is to work while studying, improving my network and getting employment once I graduated. Getting into IT, specifically system design &amp; instructional technology.


**Employment landscape (as far as I know)**

Jobs are scarce in smaller cities, since our country is still developing &amp; we are recovering from the mess made by the previous government. The people have always depended on the government to provide them jobs, this makes it common to view private companies as unsafe. IDC, I just want a job that pays well. For now I'll settle for anything RM1500/+ monthly (~$357). Low, yes, but for now...


**End-goals**

First goal is to make a stable income by 28 (~RM3K monthly), then by 35 or so, to reach the limit of RM200K (~$48K) in a local investment plan that would net me ~RM15K (~$3.6K) interest per year. I'm hoping to reach financial independence by 40. Not necessarily retiring but stable enough to live frugally yet comfortably with minimum impact in case there's an economic shitstorm, getting laid off, etc. 

Will continue to learn about investments &amp; making side money (rent, etc). Very open to move to better countries should the opportunity presents itself.

**So...**

Anything I can improve here? My plans are very pathetic but that's what I got so far. Been wanting to FIRE before knowing it's a thing. Or perhaps it's impossible by default for those unlucky enough to not be born in a developed country?

(* I've spent as much time learning/reading about optimal professional communication, negotiation, and career progression as I have FIRE*).

On occasion I'm able to work from home, which is where the insane boost in quality of life comes into play.

(*When I had my first WFH day at the company, I set the expectation to those I interact/report to that I would be available via email. Notice the lack of skype/slack/google hangout in that sentence.)

When writing software, it's pretty reasonable to not notice emails that come in, so a reasonable response time to an email is at least an hour before anyone would take issue.

Of course I have my office365 access from a browser (my phone), and since I set the expectation with my company to not expect to reach my via instant message, I don't need to be on my laptop (which would indicate I'm 'Active' (available, doing work, etc).

(* I'm early enough in my career that most of the time other people aren't coming to me with questions constantly, I'm usually the one needing to get answers form others on occasion)

This essentially allows me free reign to get my work done throughout the day, as I please.

Video games to start the morning for an hour or two? do the laundry? other chores around the house to make the girlfriend happy? Mid-day grocery run? A long walk with the girlfriend if she happens to be home that day? You name it.

If I only need to do 4 hours of work to compete the necessary work for that day, I've effectively doubled my hourly rate for the day.

As can be expected from the direction of the post, my true next aim is for full work from home privilege with my current company. I'm still less then 6-figures, but when I broke it down, I realized I valued being able to work from home outweighed a 35% raise right now.

Additionally, full time remote work would allows my girlfriend and I the freedom to only have to take one work place location into account when deciding where we want to move next which makes a really big difference when working in/around a large metro.

Even more so, I've used this to see family and friends more regularly who live a long drive from my home. Instead of leaving Friday night to make the five hour drive back home to visit, I can head out late morning and miss all the terrible traffic, and get into town early enough to have a Friday night to enjoy as opposed to getting there and going to sleep.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I’m seriously looking into buying a house, knowing that it would set me back on FI. Just wanting to know what’s the least damaging route to get there.

I’m currently 29, my expenses are 3k/mo and I’ve been saving around 4K/mo. I have about 170k saved right now, and was on track to FIRE around when I turn 40. 

Currently some options are to put the full 20% down but then dip into my Roth by about 20k and be spending 3.5k/mo on the house, or put down 15% down paying a little over around 4K/mo and not have to liquidate my Roth. 

I think some other details are that our rate is going to be 4.625 on the mortgage, my husband and i’s combined income is around 175k, let me know if any others help.

My primary motivation to reach FI/RE is to have an abundance of time to spend with the family and invest in developing my children's skills in music, art, and athletics. I also want my children to learn the pleasure of work hard. I have a dream that my children and I work side-by-side in running a simple family business, but that business is doing well enough (and we have other sources of income) that we're not slaves to the family business like my folks were. 

But in reality, I'm paralyzed by the idea of quitting my job because others depend on me right now.  Could someone direct me to someone who has a big family and still was able to achieve FI/RE status?  I'm looking for some inspiration or mentor to help calm my anxieties. 

Little about me:

* 31 years old, married 9 years (and still madly in love)
* 3 kids (6, 4, 2 y/o) + one on the way
* $115,000 salary — single income, wife doesn't work yet so she can focus on raising the kids

Financial Status: 

* \~$200,000 net worth
* $94,000 in equity in home
* $25,000 in HYSA for emergency fund
* $13,000 in cash 
* $68,000 in investments (Roth, 401k, individual, crypto, lending club, HSA, etc.)
* $324,000 remaining mortgage
* $0 consumer debt, student loans, car loans, etc.

Monthly Budget ([spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-gHCWHu970p3OLgoQWCivn87e6QCQ4Rf35qebMYS7I/edit?usp=sharing)):

* $8,135 Monthly income
* $5,103 Fixed Expenses (Mortgage, charity, etc.)
* $2,379 Variable Expenses (Groceries, utilities, etc.)
* $1,053 Net 

That is if everything works according to the monthly budget... Would love any insight or help from the FIRE community.

Anywho, I'm newer to FIRE and getting my crap together.  Maxing 401k and IRA as of this year (only have 50k in 401k and \~15k in an emergency fund to my name at this time).  Luckily no debt, don't even own a car.  Single female/no kids.  $95k salary+8%annual bonus; expenses are down now to $2900/month.

In other words, start planning now to buy in another 2 years or so a duplex or property that has a basement suite that can be rented out to cover most/all of my living expenses.  He feels that is one step I can take to free up more cash to go towards retirement funds since housing is a sizeable chunk of my expenses.  Makes sense, but then I'd have to stop contributing at an age where I need to be maxing everything every.single.year.  Thoughts on doing this??

I'm pretty risk averse actually, but at this time am willing to take on more risk in some way(s) if it means I can get to at least FI sooner (50 would be great).  I don't know what that could be, but I'm open.  Should I just keep doing what I'm doing (maxing retirement vehicles) since ""slow and steady"" supposedly wins the race?

Long time lurker, first time poster. I have a Rental property that is break-even about 10 minutes from my principal residence. I am thinking of giving notice to my tenants to move out so that I can rent out my current principal residence for a higher monthly rent. This plan will reduce our housing costs by $8000/year.

The reason I want to do this is because we are paying a lot for housing (about 30% of take home pay considering 2 incomes for me and the wife). The extra money saved can be used for paying off the house faster, increasing our savings, kids education, etc. Of course, I have to take into account moving costs and bringing up the rental property up to a certain living standards as I have a small family. So the impact really adds up after about 1 year of the switch.

The reason I am hesitant is because my wife prefers our current house because it is a somewhat nicer area. I actually do prefer it myself but I am trying to be more practical and think about the savings. 

Any advice, appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently a financial advisor at a small bank. My salary is 55k and then I get paid 50bps for every dollar I bring in.

I'm being offered a financial analyst position with the option to work from home every day. All in comp with salary and bonus is 95k so roughly 40k more than my current base.

I'm very tempted to take this job because it will help me save money much quicker. However, I'll be giving up the upside of being a financial advisor.

Truthfully, I like helping people with their money and that's why I enjoy being an advisor. However, I don't love always having to motivate bankers to refer new clients. The prospecting part of my job is not much fun. That said, I always thought the analyst type work is boring but it would be nice up work from home. Plus I'm guaranteed a much larger base where as it could be very good or very bad as an advisor.

Two very different career paths. Just curious what other people here think of each job.

I should also mention I'm in my mid 30s. Have a net worth of 250k with about 100k of which in cash and investments. My expenses are low that I could live off of the low advisor base as I build my book of clients. Or I could be saving more per year in the analyst role.

I guess the risk is earning less money today in hopes of earning more in the future. The other risk is I could be in line for promotions down the road if I take the analyst job and do well. I feel like it would take at least two years as an advisor to catch up the analyst salary and that isn't guaranteed I could catch up.

The other thing to add is I could potentially continue to provide financial advice to people in the side since I'll be working from home. Of course I won't be getting as many clients as working in a bank. But I am also trying to factor this in. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;

Ever since I discovered this sub about a year ago I've been aggressively saving. My wife and I are both 29 year old DINKs. We're both well paid software engineers and manage to save 70+% of our income.

All this money is sitting in a taxable Vanguard account and Robinhood and banks. 

Considering the fact that it'll take us nearly a 100 years to get our Green Cards our time/future in the USA is very uncertain. We're here for another 5-6 years at least barring any severe policy changes. Past the 6 year H1-B mark, extensions for H1-B visas have high rates of rejection in this current administration.

We are looking at immigrating to Canada as an option but would like to stay in the USA as long as possible because the income here is quite literally almost double of what Canadian engineers are making. Not to mention the higher income here is in USD which is a lot stronger than the CAD.

Does it make sense for me to invest in a tax safe account like an IRA? The penalty for early withdrawals makes it simply unpalatable to lock in money in these accounts if we do end up leaving the USA. 

PS: I do not contribute into my employers 401k as they do not match contributions. They simply contribute regardless of how much we do. So i'm not missing out on ""free money"".

As to where I'd like to RE, I'd really prefer USA/Canada/Europe as  opposed to going back to India. If allowed to continue working in the USA, we could easily FI within the next 10 years.

My background: I’m from Belgium, I am 26 years old and almost finished with a PhD in Computer Science and a Masters in Civil Engineering, Computer Science and thinking of going freelance. Due to a financial windfall, I am in a strong financial/personal situation: I have no rent to pay, few expenses and a good amount of savings (1M+). In the PhD, I had flexibility, freedom and independence and have several published papers at international conferences. The skills I have developed are mainly in light of PhD opportunities and research, which is IoT security, embedded devices, paper writing, presenting, giving courses and general problem solving skills. Programming skills are medium-level experience in Java, Python and C. General Computer skills are medium-level with Windows, Linux, Eclipse, Latex, Word, Excel, … I do not consider myself an expert in any of these but definitely capable.

As such, after the PhD, I would like to maintain flexibility and freedom and was thinking of going Freelance so that I can both (1) earn money and (2) enjoy flexibility to pick my own hours. I love to travel a lot, which is why I like flexibility. Also, considering the financial situation, I do not think it is necessary to work full-time but this is something I’d like to evaluate as I continue on this path. This is very general but I am looking for any and all advice for somebody with my profile and my desires, in Belgium.

So what would you advise to somebody like me? Feel free to take your answer in any direction.

More specific questions: What are essential skills to learn/develop for my intended path? Other programming languages? Stuff like VIM? Other types of skills? Generally, what skills should enable my goals the best? E.g., being an experienced Javascript guy? How important is additional certification beyond my masters and PhD? How should I approach getting work in flexible environments? Websites? Contact specialised firms? What else would you advise for work/finances for somebody in my case? Any advice you would give for somebody in my case on a more personal development type level? General life advice is welcome!

Thanks for reading this long post. I am trying to gain as much information and advice as possible.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly going back and forth with what I want to do with my current home. If I put it on the market it may sit for a few months or more (smaller 2bed/1bath but huge yard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a significant amount of cash and I know if I sell it, the closing costs will eat up any potential profit and my checking account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I rent it, I have to hire a property manager and may only net ~100 after mortgage/taxes/insurance/pm fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sell or rent??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, any advice on how to maximize my networth with this increased salary?&lt;/p&gt;

The large concern I have with never owning is getting priced out, especially in retirement and/or old age. 

Assuming someone lives in a metro area, and/or can't move wherever, whenever, a \*long term\* lack of rent control (vs. a locked in mortgage more or less) is in my mind a major concern when living off savings, and at worst, a way to really blow up a retirement plan.   


What's the wisdom on this?


Edit: 90% of response bring up “you still risk rising taxes with mortgages,” but to that: 

1) is there really a tax increase situation where (PV 30 yrs mortgage + next 30 years of only taxes) &lt; (PV 60 years of rent) is NOT the case. That obviously requires a lot of 60 yrs our type of forecasting, but I’d think the tax growth would have to be massive to really make renting PV cheaper. 

2) do taxes really factor in here at all? Assuming I want to stay in the same place for any number of reasons, I’ll be paying that tax on a home or through higher rents either way, so why can’t it be a constant to just disregard. 


Also, if you’re in a metro, why doesn’t this tip the scales to buying: 

-metro Boston, NYC, SF, etc are not getting any larger, and a major major de-gentrification would have to occur to de-Park Slope Park Slope, make times square dangerous again, take away Southie from the Yuppies, and idk whatever SF is. So does that not create a unique home price situation: if you can buy in those cities now you should, not saying home prices “will always go up,” but long term the cities will price up significantly in comparison as urbanization keeps occurring and the general population moving to cities isn’t getting smaller.

I have been a subscriber/lurker for a long time now and I thought I would finally make my first contribution to the sub. Full disclosure, my goal for this post is two-fold. First and foremost, I hope that this post can serve as some sort of inspiration for someone or, at the very least, provide some sort of value. Second, maybe someone more experienced than I can give me some pointers.

Full disclaimer, I'm don't consider myself to be an expert at investing or finance. I'm just a guy who a) has always found it to be more fun to stash my money than spend it, b) believes people have a hyper-inflated and misguided expectation of what they need to be happy/content, and c) doesn't really want to be a slave to the dollar my whole life.

So I thought it would be fun to share my story up until this point.

**Background**

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, lower-middle class. Mom was a single mother of three. No inheritance, no money for allowance. I jut had to get a job if I wanted money. So I did. I was always fascinated by technology so I ended up eventually landing a job at a laptop repair store after working various other jobs from lawn care to restaurants.

I think my mother did a remarkable job and prioritizing where her limited budget went. We always had quality food to eat, we were always warm, and we all had the opportunity to pursue higher-education; a privilege I will forever be grateful for. We still had to pay for it later but she made sure we knew it was an option.

I went to college and ended up getting a job in Software Development.

* \~$11k in Roth IRA, maxed out last two years.
* \~$50k in index funds, using the [""Core Four"" lazy portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#Core_four_portfolios). I would love to hear your thoughts here.
* \~$3k in individual stocks, I know this is probably a bad idea
* \~$20k in cryptocurrencies
* \~$20k in the bank

**Liabilities**

* \~$260k left on my mortgage
___
**Income**

* $110,000/year, not counting rental income.

Before you bite my head off, note that these are rough expenses. Sometimes they are more. Sometimes they are less. But I keep it pretty lean.

* Rent: $500
* Food &amp; Beverage: $400
* Entertainment: $30
* Transportation: $20
* Continued Education: $180
* Other: $70

[Here's a rough monthly plan I recently drafted](https://i.imgur.com/2nEhZUg.png).

I would love to hear some opinions about it.
___
**Notes on Expenses**

I have always been shocked by the few colleagues I know who are living paycheck to paycheck. It absolutely amazes me how a single person with no dependents in the technology industry could possibly manage to spend all that money. Most people just have a bloated expectation of what they need to be happy.

Some months I live off less than $1,000 for the whole month but I don't feel like I am living an abnormally frugally lifestyle. Some months I spend more like $1,500. Last month I spent a little under $1,200.

Here is a list of things that I have found to be incredibly helpful for me:

* **Food:** The vast vast majority of the eating I do is food that I have cooked at home or food from work. In addition to being expensive, the food is just terrible for you when you eat out. I also don't eat meat so I don't really have a lot of options for eating out; particularly where I live. My food and beverage budget would probably be far lower if I didn't go out for drinks so much. I value social time and I enjoy drinking.
* **Transportation:** I ride my bike to work. The metro system is also quite good where I live and it's only about a buck to ride it as far as you want. If the metro doesn't run where I need to go, Uber is also quite cheap.
* **Work Perks:** I take full advantage of every perk my work has to offer. We have catered lunch and free self-serve breakfast. We have free coffee and beer. It always blows my mind when people go out to eat anyway. My work allows me to expense my cell phone bill. If I work asks me to expense something, I gladly do it so I can get cash back on my credit card. Last month, I expensed 5 laptops for my team and got $180 in travel credit on my Chase Reserve card.
* **Research:** When I do decide to buy something, I actually do some research instead of just dropping and absurd amount on the first deal that comes along. When I was paying for my cell phone bill last year, I ended up signing up for Google Fi and paying like $35-50 a month internationally by just not using a ton of data while no on WiFi networks. Really not that hard of a habit to get into. On the topic of research, I would also note that well-research and cheap aren't always hand-in-hand. I would rather buy one good jacket that lasts me five years than 5 shit ones that last me one year each.
* **Accommodations**: I rent flats with other people. I enjoy living with others. This tip clearly isn't for everyone.
* **Credit Card Perks**: I only buy things on credit cards and pay them off at the end of every month. It's free money. A lot of credit cards also have other great perks that saves you even more money like free food in airports.
* **Location:** I have found living out of the country to be cheaper but not that much cheaper where I live. I'm in one of the more expensive area in South America. This tip clearly isn't for everyone.
* I found that selling all my stuff when I left the United States really helped me break out of a consumer mindset. I no longer mindlessly buy material objects. When I buy things, I ask myself the following questions:
   * Is this object going to save me money? I have no issue buying a coffee maker for $100 or even $300 is it means I'm not going buy coffee everyday at Starbucks. I have no issue buying a more expensive laptop if it's going to increase my productivity at work and lead to more money.
   * Is this object going to raise my standard of living in a way I care about? For me these are things like a decent quality produce, a yoga mat, a good jacket, bed, or office chair.
   * Is this object going to stimulate my brain? For me these are things like books, art, classes, and music. You'll notice that I have a whole category in my expenses for continued education. That's because it's a thing of value to me.
   * Is this object going to improve my relationship with people I care about? For me this includes things like going out for drinks. Social interaction is important to me.
   * Is this a hobby or passion that truly makes me happy? I have been a long-time skateboarder and, if my skateboard breaks, I will buy a new one without even thinking about it. Instead of having a ton of hobbies that I am sort-of into I have a few hobbies that I am really into.

I don't think these guidelines are for everyone. Maybe not even for the majority of people. My point is that, if you can identify what's important to you, then you can set rules that you can use to determine how/when you want to spend your money.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this stuff because it's incredibly interesting to me.
___
**Regrets &amp; Staying the Course**

Everyone just wants to get rich quick. At one point I was up to $60k in crypto. Now I have less than $20k. I play poker games. I put money into individual stocks even though I hardly know what I am doing. Deep down I know that my best chance is staying the course. As you can see from my monthly plan, I am still planning on diversifying into these other high-risk areas a bit but I'm not going to let it ruin my chances of an almost sure-thing. Remember, there's a reason this approach is so popular. It's because it works.
___
**Final Words**

The last thing I want to touch on here is around depression. I know a lot of us are in offices. I sit in one every day and I see what it does to people. Instead of looking towards a future where we don't let money guide our decisions, we need to remember that we are in control of our decisions now. It doesn't have to suck along the way and this goal isn't worth your mental and physical well-being. Don't be afraid to make a change. You can take a pay cut to get out of a situation you hate or completely pivot your career without giving up this dream. Don't be afraid to alter your plan in exchange for a healthy mental state.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/2nEhZUg.png""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a rough monthly plan I recently drafted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear some opinions about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes on Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been shocked by the few colleagues I know who are living paycheck to paycheck. It absolutely amazes me how a single person with no dependents in the technology industry could possibly manage to spend all that money. Most people just have a bloated expectation of what they need to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months I live off less than $1,000 for the whole month but I don&amp;#39;t feel like I am living an abnormally frugally lifestyle. Some months I spend more like $1,500. Last month I spent a little under $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of things that I have found to be incredibly helpful for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food:&lt;/strong&gt; The vast vast majority of the eating I do is food that I have cooked at home or food from work. In addition to being expensive, the food is just terrible for you when you eat out. I also don&amp;#39;t eat meat so I don&amp;#39;t really have a lot of options for eating out; particularly where I live. My food and beverage budget would probably be far lower if I didn&amp;#39;t go out for drinks so much. I value social time and I enjoy drinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; I ride my bike to work. The metro system is also quite good where I live and it&amp;#39;s only about a buck to ride it as far as you want. If the metro doesn&amp;#39;t run where I need to go, Uber is also quite cheap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Perks:&lt;/strong&gt; I take full advantage of every perk my work has to offer. We have catered lunch and free self-serve breakfast. We have free coffee and beer. It always blows my mind when people go out to eat anyway. My work allows me to expense my cell phone bill. If I work asks me to expense something, I gladly do it so I can get cash back on my credit card. Last month, I expensed 5 laptops for my team and got $180 in travel credit on my Chase Reserve card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research:&lt;/strong&gt; When I do decide to buy something, I actually do some research instead of just dropping and absurd amount on the first deal that comes along. When I was paying for my cell phone bill last year, I ended up signing up for Google Fi and paying like $35-50 a month internationally by just not using a ton of data while no on WiFi networks. Really not that hard of a habit to get into. On the topic of research, I would also note that well-research and cheap aren&amp;#39;t always hand-in-hand. I would rather buy one good jacket that lasts me five years than 5 shit ones that last me one year each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodations&lt;/strong&gt;: I rent flats with other people. I enjoy living with others. This tip clearly isn&amp;#39;t for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit Card Perks&lt;/strong&gt;: I only buy things on credit cards and pay them off at the end of every month. It&amp;#39;s free money. A lot of credit cards also have other great perks that saves you even more money like free food in airports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; I have found living out of the country to be cheaper but not that much cheaper where I live. I&amp;#39;m in one of the more expensive area in South America. This tip clearly isn&amp;#39;t for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found that selling all my stuff when I left the United States really helped me break out of a consumer mindset. I no longer mindlessly buy material objects. When I buy things, I ask myself the following questions:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this object going to save me money? I have no issue buying a coffee maker for $100 or even $300 is it means I&amp;#39;m not going buy coffee everyday at Starbucks. I have no issue buying a more expensive laptop if it&amp;#39;s going to increase my productivity at work and lead to more money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this object going to raise my standard of living in a way I care about? For me these are things like a decent quality produce, a yoga mat, a good jacket, bed, or office chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this object going to stimulate my brain? For me these are things like books, art, classes, and music. You&amp;#39;ll notice that I have a whole category in my expenses for continued education. That&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s a thing of value to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this object going to improve my relationship with people I care about? For me this includes things like going out for drinks. Social interaction is important to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this a hobby or passion that truly makes me happy? I have been a long-time skateboarder and, if my skateboard breaks, I will buy a new one without even thinking about it. Instead of having a ton of hobbies that I am sort-of into I have a few hobbies that I am really into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think these guidelines are for everyone. Maybe not even for the majority of people. My point is that, if you can identify what&amp;#39;s important to you, then you can set rules that you can use to determine how/when you want to spend your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your thoughts on this stuff because it&amp;#39;s incredibly interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regrets &amp;amp; Staying the Course&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone just wants to get rich quick. At one point I was up to $60k in crypto. Now I have less than $20k. I play poker games. I put money into individual stocks even though I hardly know what I am doing. Deep down I know that my best chance is staying the course. As you can see from my monthly plan, I am still planning on diversifying into these other high-risk areas a bit but I&amp;#39;m not going to let it ruin my chances of an almost sure-thing. Remember, there&amp;#39;s a reason this approach is so popular. It&amp;#39;s because it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I want to touch on here is around depression. I know a lot of us are in offices. I sit in one every day and I see what it does to people. Instead of looking towards a future where we don&amp;#39;t let money guide our decisions, we need to remember that we are in control of our decisions now. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to suck along the way and this goal isn&amp;#39;t worth your mental and physical well-being. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to make a change. You can take a pay cut to get out of a situation you hate or completely pivot your career without giving up this dream. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to alter your plan in exchange for a healthy mental state.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of us talk about taking time off and striving to spend when retired, but it seems there are pockets of millennials who would rather do a long sabbatical while they are young since they feel resigned to work until their 60s or 70s anyways. Another common theme seems to be workers who leave careers without anything lined up due to anxiety/stress or an emptiness in their work.

I want to thank everyone for what I've learned so far, we have started getting serious and understand the importance of maxing out of 401Ks and ROTH IRAs as well as the magic of long term compounding interest.

**Basic Background**

I am 35, she is 29 and we have a 2 yr old son.  In the near future we want to have another kid.  Our overall goal can be characterized as a fatFIRE approach with target retirement ages of 55 and 49, so nothing too extreme.  This means 20 more years of staying the course and retiring with 2 paid off houses (one rental), 2 kids through college or similar investment in their futures' and \~$3M in the bank.  We are interested in making smart choices but aren't trying to live on $30k a year and retire when we are 40.  In our immediate future we would like to purchase a second house for our primary residence and hold the current house as a rental...this will mean saving for a down payment.

**Current income and savings streams:**

We both work at Fortune 100 companies with a combined salary of $200k a year + up to 15% bonus

We both max our 401k and ROTH IRAs and plan to save an additional 10k /yr in taxable accounts

We also each carry a life insurance policy, mine with a small cash rider (more on this later)

**Current Combined Assets:**

NET WORTH = \~$xxx (includes primary residence equity)

401k - $xxx

ROTHs- $xxx

Taxable accounts- $cx

Cash- $xx (downpayment fund)

Life insurance cash fund- $2700 (\~$600k combined death benefit)

**QUESTIONS:**

What can I do with the cash we are holding to save for the new house?  We need to save an additional 30k to hit our goal, so we need another 12 months.  $20k of our cash is in a checking account that earns 2% but the rest is rotting at some stupidly low rate (basically 0).  What can I do to not lose to inflation with out ""risking"" the money over a 6-12 month time frame?

Life insurance- Good idea for FIRE or bad idea?  I never see this discussed and am wondering if it just falls into the category of ""invest the money yourself in an index fund and avoid the fees, you'll be better off"" or what...

I guess its important to highlight the reason we decided to go with the insurance in the first place.  I have a pre-exsisting chronic medical condition that is sure to shorten my life and since the insurance is through my employer via a group policy and I am under certain benefit thresholds I don't need to pass a physical or have a review of my medical history.  Therefore, relatively speaking, the rates feel like a deal.

So this is really a two part question-

1. Should I continue to carry the cheap insurance ($25 a month combined for both us)
2. What about the cash rider?  I am contributing a very small amount right now, something like $50 a month.

Some choice bits from the article:

&gt; Wells Fargo financial advisers pushed clients into products that generated additional fees and often moved client assets between different products or investing platforms to generate more revenue and bigger bonuses ...

&gt; Advisers frequently targeted wealthy clients in Wells Fargo’s private bank, sometimes steering them into alternative-investment funds of which Wells Fargo was the majority owner—allowing the San Francisco bank to collect another helping of fees. 

&gt; Advisers across the wealth management business sometimes shifted client assets between products such as certificates of deposit and structured notes, or put clients into products that earned the bank higher fees, current and former employees said. 

&gt; Among employees, 2015 became known as “the year of the annuity” because advisers would push clients into these higher-fee products to meet their revenue targets. Some advisers would redeem clients from annuities that had large surrender charges and place them into another product with annual fees of 1% to 1.5%, a practice known as churning, employees said. 

I'm sure most of us here have both the knowledge, discipline, and confidence to manage our own investments. But for those who rely on other people to manage their money, this is a prime example of why you should review your financial adviser's recommendations and investment activity. The wealth management industry is rife with bad actors and conflicts of interest. 

Make sure your savings and investments are working to build your own retirement, not your adviser's. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/whistleblowers-detail-wells-fargo-wealth-management-woes-1532707096?mod=hp_lead_pos3""&gt;Whistleblowers highlight shady practices in Wells Fargo Wealth Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some choice bits from the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo financial advisers pushed clients into products that generated additional fees and often moved client assets between different products or investing platforms to generate more revenue and bigger bonuses ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisers frequently targeted wealthy clients in Wells Fargo’s private bank, sometimes steering them into alternative-investment funds of which Wells Fargo was the majority owner—allowing the San Francisco bank to collect another helping of fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisers across the wealth management business sometimes shifted client assets between products such as certificates of deposit and structured notes, or put clients into products that earned the bank higher fees, current and former employees said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among employees, 2015 became known as “the year of the annuity” because advisers would push clients into these higher-fee products to meet their revenue targets. Some advisers would redeem clients from annuities that had large surrender charges and place them into another product with annual fees of 1% to 1.5%, a practice known as churning, employees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure most of us here have both the knowledge, discipline, and confidence to manage our own investments. But for those who rely on other people to manage their money, this is a prime example of why you should review your financial adviser&amp;#39;s recommendations and investment activity. The wealth management industry is rife with bad actors and conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your savings and investments are working to build your own retirement, not your adviser&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;

So my wife and I have come on some good fortune (financially). 

Intro - My wife and I are both physicians.  I'm an internist and shes an OBGYN .  We live in a HCOL area and do our best to live slightly below our means, but certainly nowhere near what I see most people doing on here.  Currently our combined gross is around $600k, and we manage to put away a little over $100k per year.  (We have a daughter with severe disabilities who requires around $75-100K per year in care )

Thankfully due to generous parents we both have no school debt, and our savings now are around $900k.  We're both in our early 40s.  

Recently, my wife inherited an interest in her large (to me) family business which is now in its 3rd generation. So we've found that due to this, she's going to get around $400k per year in distributions.  This of course is amazing and something we're thrilled about it.  There are however some restrictions, for example 

1. Our use of the money has to be approved by a corporate trustee
2. Its based on profits, and can vary at any time or stop, although the company has been profitable for over 60 years in a row.  

So I've always been interested more in FI, while my wife is really tired of work and wants to leave.  Her hours suck and the work is really high stress.  She wants to spend time more time with the kids and leave work entirely.  Now this money will entirely replace her salary which is almost exactly the same amount.  My concern is that we should just bank the money for a few years and have her go half time.  I fear the distributions could stop, but it doesn't bother her.

# Story

Yes, another single 26-yo avocado-wielding CA bay-area tech post. You're welcome. But I have a somewhat specific reason for wanting advice. Tech wasn't my initial interest, so I got a little later start; I've only been doing this for 3 or so years. So you might look at my assets and my income, and be like ""hmmmm this doesn't quite add up."" I have financial support because of the life insurance policy and unexpected early death of my dad, who died \~40yo from lung cancer. Unfortunately, my dad's side of the family has a history of early death by lung cancer (despite not smoking, him and both his parents died of lung cancer). So I'm trying to figure how lean I want to FI, balancing emotions and logic.

I don't dislike my job. However, the thing that terrifies me the most is taking too long to escape from the office, not live life, and not make an individual impact on the world. I think having experienced early death in my family has made me very aware of enjoying live vs making money. My dad definitely did NOT get to do everything he wanted in life. It's safe to say  that his passing has had an impact on me emotionally, and so this is why I'm conflicted enough about my goals to ask the more un-biased advice of y'all, whom have similar ambitions as myself.

I'm currently trying to lean/coast-ish FI at 300-400k investments + rentals. But I feel like my emotions might be pushing me to jump too early because I feel like I'm on a more constricted timeline than I actually am (medical advancements + better knowledge of family history means maybe I don't die early)? Also, that financial snowball effect is so powerful, and I recognize that I'm in a stupid-easy financial situation to make that happen if I'm patient.

I'm also pretty sure that I can get my spending down. I intend to travel after I finish working, but my spending is higher than I'd expect right now because I'm purposely living in San Francisco city proper (it's close to work and commuting is the devil). Because of that, a lot of my monthly spending is on rent. I don't intend to sit still after I leave the rat race, either. I want to try teaching English abroad and work on personal projects. I'm hoping that if I can kinda leanFI/coastFI my way through travel via teaching English, I can build a personal project on the side that enough income to help accelerate me from coasting into full-on FI. I'm also currently single, and would like to have a family at some point. I'm not entirely opposed to turning FI -&amp;gt; sabbatical and finding a job after traveling to support a family if necessary, but it's not super on my radar at the moment, and I'm still unsure about that.

But I was mostly looking on opinions of what I was thinking. I get the feeling that y'all are gonna tell me to calm down and let my wealth build for a bit longer, but I kinda need someone else to tell me.


**Edit:**
After reading comments, I think I’ve been focusing too much on FI rather than my actual issue here, which is nervousness about my future health.  I think I’m realizing that this is actually a conversation I should have with my doctor in order to relieve that stress and have a plan to make sure I am as healthy as I can be, rather than constantly pushing the pace of my life.  I def still plan on reaching FI quickly still, but I’m probably being rash if I do it as fast as I had planned in my head, and I need to first and foremost make a plan to maintain my health (I mean that’s part of what FI is all about, isnt it?).

Full disclosure, my goal for this post is to get some guidance and advise on the next steps for FIRE.

Full disclaimer, I'm don't consider myself to be an expert at investing or finance, and would really appreciate your advise and guidance.

**Background**

I am currently in one of the big Midwest city and going to be here, working in IT. Wife works part-time, and kid in high school.

**Career** 

* 2018: Recently changed job, went from 150k+bonus to 190k+bonus, wife makes 40k

**Assets**

* \~$450k house. Paid off.
* \~$300k in 401k, 
* \~80k in Pension, recently moved to IRA
* \~275k rental property, apartment. generating around 24k rental income per year
* \~700k cash, CDs, saving/checking, index funds
* \~50k in cryptocurrencies
* \~20k gold/silver

**Liabilities**

* \~$150k left on my mortgage, which i took from primary residence to buy the investment property (can easily payoff if advised)
* \~30k in car loan (going to pay off very soon too)

**Income**

* $250k per year
* $24k rental income

**Expense**:

* Very standard expenses, nothing crazy or out of ordinary, very comfortable lifestyle.
* Use slick-deals, coupons, miles/points for all the travels
* Not listing detailed expenses, as you get the idea with my use of slickdeals, coupons, miles/points, manufactured spending, ebay selling.

**I would like to get advise on following items:**

1. What would be the best way to invest cash (currently in mix of CDs, savings/checking, Index funds)
2. Want to get in a position that I could get around 50k-70k yearly income from rental income, investments and other ways.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been a subscriber/lurker for a long time now and I thought I would finally make my first contribution to the sub.

We are both in our early 30's, no children and both 100% on board with not wanting them. I am trying to decide on possibly selling a rental property I inherited 5 years ago, and am not sure what to do. The house is paid off and worth around $435,000. I inherited the house from my father, and I give my mother who is 76 the rent money from this house every month. Rent is $1200 a month, and I give my mother $700. The rest is put aside for taxes and insurance on the home in separate checking account and is not part of my savings. If sold, there will be some capital gains and depreciation to recapture. It is in Jekyll Island GA, if anyone is familiar. It's a small coastal island, and the house is across the street from the ocean. I recently had to spend 8k on all sorts of plumbing issues as the house is 50 years old, and it depleted my emergency fund to 5k. I am feeling lost if I should hold onto this place for the foreseeable future, or sell. If I sell I will be giving my mother some of the profit. It's hard to gauge what it could be worth in the next 10-20 years, but it's also a huge head ache to me. 

**FIRE Progress:** 380,000 in Inherited IRA across Vanguard index funds.

**Gross Salary/Wages:** 50,000 combined for my husband and I :\\ and 8000k a year in RMDS.

**Other Ordinary Income:** Spouse started a side hustle which is going pretty well, paid for all the tools in cash before I changed jobs and he's made 7k since Feb. Should be turning actual profit very soon. Possibly once he builds more business we will be making more, but not sure yet.

**Assets:** paid cash for home three years ago from inheritance money so we have no mortgage which is a huge help especially with our current salary. 

**Liabilities:** A car loan, owe 9k left on it put down 5k from savings before the plumbing issues at rental. I plan to have it paid off before the end of the year as I hate debt. We don't have carry any credit card debt or student loan debt. 

Overall, I feel very blessed, just not sure if it would be better to sell the house. I could invest profit but leave some to rebuild a healthy emergency fund, and pay off the car. I feel it could really bring me more security and less stress. But I think, well what this property could be worth in the next few decades? The short term part of me wants to sell, but I am just looking for any advice. Thanks guys.

It's actually possible to quantify this multiplier effect with just a few assumptions.

Every dollar I spend could otherwise be invested, and generate 4% per year, inflation adjusted, indefinitely. (Caveat that over a long time horizon this has somewhere around a 95% success rate. Feel free to use 3.5%)

This means that depending on how old you are, you will get to spend that same dollar multiple times over the course of your life, and still have the dollar at the end of it. 

The equation is as simple as this: **(life expectancy - current age)/25 + 1**. Replace the 25 with the inverse of your desired withdrawal percentage.

For someone who is 35 and expects to live to 90, their number is 3.2. This means that for the amount of every expenditure avoided, they will get to spend 3.2 times that amount (inflation adjusted) over the course of their life. If we value our future equally to our present, it only makes sense to buy things or experiences that are worth 3.2x the actual price.

This multiplier also works for earnings. Each dollar you earn today you will get to spend 3.2x using the assumptions above. This number, of course, goes down as you get older.

There is some argument for removing the +1 if you place no value on having assets at the end of life, but I don't recommend it. Even if you don't have anyone you want to leave the money to, and don't care about charitable giving, there are some good arguments (like expensive care) for maintaining an asset base.

I find this thinking very useful in practice. Is that workday lunch really worth $10\*3.2? To me, probably not. Is a few happy hour beers with friends worth $10\*3.2? For sure. That extra $5k\*3.2 for the newer car? Probably not.

Today I woke up to a pleasant surprise on my Mint profile. Thanks to a rally in the market yesterday and getting my expense reports paid out, I'd hit the big [$250K](https://i.imgur.com/9iVa27V.png).

I keep a very close eye on income and expenses, tracking each through Mint, but exporting to my own personal spreadsheet that I can use to play around with the data.

That leads me to my question... what kind of growth would be reasonable to expect in the future? And what trend line best approximates that growth? 

[This](https://i.imgur.com/gko90Ep.png) is my net worth graph starting from 01/01/13 through today 07/26/18. The x axis represents number of months. I've outfit the data to three different types of trend lines that Excel offers:

1. Linear (y = 3405.8x - 24174)
2. Polynomial order 2 (y = 46.818x^2 + 175.3x + 13515)
3. Exponential (y = 12966e^0.0468x)

It is my (and my future wife's) goal to retire with spending of $72K per year, allowing us $3K each per month. We like to travel and enjoy a nice dinner out now and again, so this falls into the ""find the life you want to live and then save for it"" mindset. Using the 4% withdrawal rate rule, we would require a net worth of $1.8M. This post only focuses on *my* net worth as I do not track hers all that closely, though I know hers is of a similar value thanks to an inheritance she received.

Because my career (engineer) tends to be more lucrative than hers (SLP), I expect my savings to make up ~$1M of the $1.8M required for our goal. Let's use that number of one million to calculate the expected retirement time frame.

1. Linear (x = ~301, so about 19.5 years from now)
2. Polynomial order 2 (x = ~143, so about 6.25 years from now)
3. Exponential (x = ~93, so about 2 years from now)

For reference, I'm 27 living in a LCOL area. I began my career in 2013 making $65K and now make $90K in 2018. I do not expect this to increase at a consistent rate because well... quite frankly I'm not all that career driven and believe I'm overpaid as it is.

I have to imagine the true number lies somewhere in between the linear and the polynomial trend lines, but I'm curious to what other's experiences are. Obviously I understand kids and unexpected life events will cause these graphs to shift substantially, but I'm looking for a theoretical analysis. What's my predicted retirement age?

Any feedback you all have is welcomed!

UPDATE: At the suggestion of many of the responses in the comments, I generated a future investment balance projection based on contributing ~$3K per month (my current average) with varying yearly growth rates (4%-7%). Looks like with even a conservative 5% growth rate, I could still reach the $1M target by 2030. This seems to be in line with my projection earlier that the more realistic number would lie somewhere between the polynomial and linear regression.

Never stop interviewing. I would advise going on interviews at least once every six months, even if you are happily employed. This has multiple benefits:

* Interviewing is a skill and interviewing regularly will keep it sharp
* You will stay on top trends in your field and the skills that companies within it are looking for
* You may just stumble upon a job you really like, so you never actually have to ""look for a job""

What experiences have you all had when job hunting or job hopping, and what lessons have you gleaned from it? 

Have you ever switched jobs when trying to migrate to a different city? Different country? Did you identify a job you wanted or a place you wanted to live first?

Did you go back to school or develop a new skill that allowed you to transition into a better paying career? How did you make that decision and what did you consider?

This article may not jive with the FIRE crowd, but it might create some constructive discussion. It even calls out the idea of planning to diligently and frugally save as almost naive (since no one assumes bad things happening). Although, that can go the other way if you put all of your eggs in a house. Or assume that urban homes are going to continue growing at a rate that the stock market is. 

Is prioritizing your home as a retirement vehicle understated here in /r/financialindependence?

I am very new to the community and I wonder if there are any people who can share their wisdom with me.

Basic facts about me:

My base salary is $97k + yearly bonus $10k. I live in NYC and work in finance.

Excluding the bonus, my monthly after tax take home salary is 6k.

My budget:

Rent+ food $1400

Metrocard $125

401K $400

Insurance $200

Clothing $100

Dining out $50

Phone+internet $60

General needs (happy hour networking, dating, laundry...) $165

In total, I spend about $2500 on everything and save $3500, giving me a savings rate of almost 60%. And this is without the yearly bonus. I still live in a graduate dorm, and work as an RA so I have no water/electricity bills or anything, and get a discounted room. My dorm requires all residents to eat at the cafeteria so there is no way I can reduce my rent+ food bill (it is a fixed price) and I make too much money to qualify for any kind of scholarship. I was living here free when I was a grad student last year with my scholarships.

1. Do you think there are any ways I can improve my budget? Or should I focus on maintaining this budget?
2. As a relatively young woman, I wonder if I am hurting my chances of dating/finding a boyfriend by focusing so much on saving money. Just this week, I turned down invitations for two social events just because I didn't want to spend money (one of them had a cover charge of $50, the other one was at an expensive bar with drinks averaging $20). In my free time, I go to a cafe close by that has unlimited coffee refills for $3 with books I borrow from library and watch a lot of youtube videos. Do you think I am ruining my dating prospects for turning down invitations? I still budget for some happy hours, but I only go to those for professional reasons. Are there any free ways to date if you are not a super hot/attractive woman?

I thought that could be fun, and they're a good bunch, but the whole knowledge worker thing is just... soul-sucking.

One job came up locally that seems to fit my personality - a local dealership needs a ""valet"". The job is taking in cars for service and jot down mileage and the person's name and hand it off to the service writer. Then get the car to the mechanics and then drive the customer home or to their office and then pick them up later.
I'd get to drive different cars (I love driving), I get to chat with people while I drive (I'm not averse to chatting) and I have no on-call, night or weekend work and no steep learning curve or any other crap like that.

PLUS, I could get a discount on car parts (I do all the work on my own cars) and potentially dibs on cars being traded in (if they're old and cool enough to where I would want it).

I won’t get too preachy and will make sure to share as much detail as I can.  I know my favorite posts in the subreddit are the ones that include the raw details.  I’ll jump out and admit that Bay Area tech salaries are insane.  I work my ass off but do not pretend I am not very fortunate (touched on later in my advice below).  I also wanted to share that these career's and salaries are not just for engineers and computer scientists.

All reported amounts are invested assets.  This is less than networth but after the sale of my home back in Florida last year it is the majority of my network less a yearish in CDs/savings as an emergency fund.

**FIRE Goal:** $2.16M Invested to provide \~$75k Per year (3.5% withdraw rate) +400k Set Aside to Purchase a House.  (My original plan was $75k per year with a paid off house.  That was easy to think about in Florida, but I am not certain where I will settle just yet.  Current expenses when adjusting for non HCOL area have us very comfortable at 75k including housing costs.)

**Income:**  My partner and I both work for one of the FAANGs in the Bay Area and had total compensation north of $400k.  I also had a one time bump last year due to a house sale from back in Florida.

**Savings:**  \&gt;$150k per year into 401ks, After Tax 401ks and taxable accounts.  I front load most of my employer investments each year (max out contributions in the first 6 months).

**Major Expenses:**  Usual Bay Area headaches with housing and childcare making up &gt;$80k per year.  Luckily my FIRE goal also lines up around when they would be able to public schools for elementary.

**Allocation**:  53/36/11 (Domestic Equities/ International Equities/ Bonds) Remember this doens’t include my emergency fund which mentally I include in my bond allocation but do not include in the above.  My goal bond holding are 15% which I have been heavily investing into muni bonds the past year via contributions to get my ratio’s closer to my goal.

**My Favorite Charts:**

* [Overall Investment Trends Broken Out by Contributions &amp; Gains](https://i.imgur.com/KVV3Ce6.png) (Gains is all investment gains and dividends)
* [Total Investments Stacked by Account Type](https://i.imgur.com/G0gE31V.png) (Helpful to see rapid acceleration of taxable plus you can see when I started contributing to a mega roth after losing access to contribute to a roth for a few years)
* [Days Between Milestones](https://i.imgur.com/RvlgeHc.png):  This was created after a reddit thread on this subject.  It tracks the amount of time between $100k milestones.  It has flattened out and it is worth highlighting that only in the past 2 years have I ever gone below a milestone.  Ie I dropped below 1.4M nearly 5 times before market gains and contributions pushed me passed up back towards 1.5M
* [Retirement Projections](https://i.imgur.com/52nFe04.png):  Every year I model out my planned contributions along with very simple 5% gains.

**Personal Base Salary History** (Later on equity contributes a large portion of my salary but isn’t included here)

* 2008 New Grad:  $37k
* 2009: $44.5k (+20% new job)
* 2009: $48.5k (+9%, performance based raise)
* 2010: $48.5k (No raise this year, switch jobs at the same salary but more room to grow)
* 2011: $60k (+23.7% Performance based raise, it had been &gt;500 days since my last raise)
* 2012: $66k (+10% annual performance raise)
* 2013: $80k (+21.21% Was a raise to get me closer to market salary and an effort for my employer to retain me, went along with a fancy inflated title)
* 2014: $138k (+72.5%, recruited to the bay area as a “data scientist”)
* 2015: $142k (+3%, percentage wise the smallest raise I ever received.  Clearly an inflation based raise)
* 2015:  $158k (+11%, Promoted during the year)

* 2017: $190k (+12%, performance related raise)
* 2018: $210k (10%, promotion)

**High Level Advice**

1. Just accept that you have been dealt a good fucking hand in this game called life if you are even in the position to think this is possible.
2. You can’t plan life.  If never works how you expect.  I could never have planned my career in the way it ended up.  Be opportunistic with new opportunities that you didn’t expect arise… but don’t burn too many bridges to get there. (Especially if you work in some of the more incestuous industries like tech).
3. Acknowledge that I am not just one person.  Going through the majority of my adult life with a like minded partner has had a huge multiplier.  Economies of scale are powerful.  Even just needing a 1 bedroom in a HCOL city while you are DINKs can allow for heavy savings in key early years.  Trust me I tried finding another couple with a kid to further take advantage of this but it kept attracting a weird swinger vibe.
4. Don’t overthink it.  The basics of FIRE are not complicated.  Just save as much as you can.  As you progress don’t let life inflate too much and keep your savings rates high.  Don’t kill yourself here.  Live the life you want now.  That might be the same one in FIRE (minus the job) or it could be completely different.  But it is your life and you only get one of them.

**College -&gt; Career Progression Story**

I am not special.  We both graduated in the middle of the great recession with damn liberal arts degrees (economics).  I wanted to go into banking but the career fairs at my state university in florida were spartan.  Friends with top honors were getting their offers rescinded from the key players and I couldn’t even land an interview.

Luckily one of those companies still showing up to the career fair had a local internship for “Internet Marketing/Business Development”.  I interned with them the entire year primarily doing grunt analytics work in excel running very basic calculations but I was working with numbers and solving real problems which was more fulfilling than I thought.  The next year (summer before senior year) I had multiple internet companies very interested in someone with the exact experience I had.  I was still trying to get finance related work but outside of selling insurance there didn’t seem to be anything there.  I opportunistically took advantage of that random niche experience I seemed to have.

I graduated and kept working at the company I interned for.  I got more and more involved in the analytics side of things and switched to a bigger company where I could learn more from (As well as after a year of no raises).  Each job I invested heavily in the technical side of things, pushing my employer to pay for some training classes and showing them the value from those classes.  It started with Excel, then SQL followed by Python.  Each leaned on the job in an effort to my current job better so I could focus on the next biggest challenge the company faced.  Each time I did this I was involved in hiring my replacement for that role and training them.

4 years ago I get a call from a recruiter for one of the FAANGs for a Data Science role.  I never really considered what I was doing more than data analytics, product analytics, web analytics or even just internet marketing but if the bay area wanted to call me a scientist that was fine with me.  This was the biggest salary jump percentage wise of my career.  That said I wasn’t kidding myself.  I knew rents in the Bay Area were insane and calculated that it would only be a marginal raise.  I didn’t factor in how much my salary would continue to increase while holding expenses constant.  This allowed for extremely sizable savings the past few years.

My plan was to that for 5 years and go back to Florida and be one those California assholes who complain about how cheap everything is.  That said I extended the “5 more years out here” every year.  I have continued to progress into a data science manager and feel challenged by the problems I have to solve every day.  I still want out but feel it would be insane to leave this beautiful golden goose in what feels like the absolute best time ever to be in tech.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan is to retire by 35.

They're talking about solely living on rental income, and this is something I'm not sure I'm getting.

It may come off as an extremely dumb question, but I'll risk it:

&amp;nbsp;

My friend just acquired a duplex.

Monthly: 2000$ mortgage + 300 taxes/repairs/misc. = 2300$/mo

Rent: 650 unit 1 + 1200 unit 2 = 1800$/mo

--
So on top of paying his own rent, he has to drop an additional 500$ to keep his duplex running.
Now at the end of year, he has to shell out additional cash to pay the income taxes incurred from the rental income.

--
From what I understand, ONLY after the duplex is paid off (in 25 years), that he'll be able to stop working a dayjob and live off the rental income only.

Regardless of the number of properties he plans to acquire. He'll always be in the negative UNTIL he doesn't carry any mortgage anymore.

In 25 years, he'll be 55. Certainly a good age to retire, with rental income and if he sells, he'll rack up a large amount of cash.

But that's at 55 years old, after paying taxes for those properties out of your own pocket.

&amp;nbsp;

My question is, people who are in their 30s or 40s living off rental income only? How do they do it? 

Does that basically mean they started off wealthy and were able to pay the properties cash or extremely fast?
Or is there some Real Estate concept I'm not getting.


Thanks


**EDIT**: So the consensus: be rich from the start and buy cash or with a huge downpayment. Real estate is not for the average schmuck with a 45K salary.

&lt;p&gt;Rent: 650 unit 1 + 1200 unit 2 = 1800$/mo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on top of paying his own rent, he has to drop an additional 500$ to keep his duplex running.
Now at the end of year, he has to shell out additional cash to pay the income taxes incurred from the rental income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, ONLY after the duplex is paid off (in 25 years), that he&amp;#39;ll be able to stop working a dayjob and live off the rental income only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the number of properties he plans to acquire. He&amp;#39;ll always be in the negative UNTIL he doesn&amp;#39;t carry any mortgage anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 25 years, he&amp;#39;ll be 55. Certainly a good age to retire, with rental income and if he sells, he&amp;#39;ll rack up a large amount of cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s at 55 years old, after paying taxes for those properties out of your own pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, people who are in their 30s or 40s living off rental income only? How do they do it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that basically mean they started off wealthy and were able to pay the properties cash or extremely fast?
Or is there some Real Estate concept I&amp;#39;m not getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: So the consensus: be rich from the start and buy cash or with a huge downpayment. Real estate is not for the average schmuck with a 45K salary. &lt;/p&gt;

in the aforementioned, it is somewhat implied that starting your own business or doing investments would be more profitable than a 9-5 job.  Sounds cool, but how likely it is to realize such thing?

First case, investments; eg. stocks, mutual founds, indices.... Say that one earns 100kUSD per year or 75kUSD net, which is not an unusual salary in a tech field. Assuming that one manages to put half of net income on the side, that is about 35kUSD at disposal for investments. So how to turn this into passive a income? Quick google search reveals, that investments *average* from 0-10% ROI/year, under risk involved, which is apparently greater than the one at 9-5job. To be able to generate 100kUSD under say, 7% ROI, a 1.5MUSD of capital needed. And to create this capital with specified salary while taking compounding in account, a time of 20years is needed. A way too long - this sounds more like a retirement plan than anything else.

Second case, starting own business. Say that as a business owner you are able to suck 5% of company's capital per year, and to get a 100kUSD salary, there needs to be 2MUSD of capital. Not sure how likely is to be able to attract other investors to invest 2MUSD in your company, because obviously, you can't fund the company with those 35kUSD at disposal, which is at this scale is just a pocket money. And of course, as 9 out of 10 startups fail, there is 90% of chance that you won't make anything, other than blow up money. This is just the money side of it, but it's somewhat known that business owners work their asses off with long work weeks under high stress and might not earn that much as 9-5 tech field employees. On the other hand in a 9-5 job you do your work, go home and take the paycheck at the end of the month.Simple.

Can I conclude that there is no reasonable way to substitute a 100kUSD job with a 100kUSD of passive income within a  short time-frame, e.g. two years?

I know this is not always the 'best' decision, but it feels good. I had an adjustable mortgage which went from 4.5 to 5.8% this month so I decided it was time. 

I'm hoping to get some input from the community on things I should consider, or could be doing better. I have learned a lot from the the people here.

I've been working hard the last 5 years, taking side gigs, investing in real-estate, upping my 401k, all in an effort to get to FIRE before I knew it existed. Here's my situation, 41, married with 2 kids under 5 years old and a stay at home mom. I want to spend as much time with them as possible as they grow up, which ties back to my massive change in goals to get financially secure. I always had 'plenty' of cash from decent paying jobs. I was frugal, and avoided debt, unlike just about all of my friends, but just saved $, and did not invest much I am afraid. I'd have been done years ago if I had some financial guidance I think, but I'm not complaining, I'm very comfortable and think I've done a decent job making up lost time.

My goal is to get to a point I can FIRE with as little risk of it going wrong as possible. 

Here is where I am today:

Income: 
120k W2. currently have max 18.5k going to 401k, and $400 a month to an HSA.

~8,200 a month from rentals I own, I manage these and do most of the maintenance myself as well for now in an effort to get as much $ as possible.
I made another ~20k from side gigs last year as well.

Assets:
My home ~280k (no mortgage as of today!)

Rental 1 ~180k (no mortgage!)

Rental 2 ~180k (75k mortgage @ 4.6%)

Rental 3 ~160k (43k mortgage @ 4.5%)

Rental 4 ~300k (120k mortgage @ 5%)

Rental 5 ~100k (42k mortgage @ 4.2%)

Vacant land 1 ~100k

Vacant land 2 ~30k

Cash left liquid after paying off home is 100k

401k 190k

3 cars that are worth maybe 15k combined, haha..

My only debts are the mortgages, nothing else. I know I have 'too much' liquid cash, but I have a reason. I have used my cash to acquire the last couple rentals, and then did cash out refi's at very conservative LTV's. I was thinking of buying more, maybe getting more agressive and getting a small apartment building?... I know I'm super heavy on realestate though, so not sure I should keep down that path even though it has treated me really well so far. 

My net worth went from around 300k to around 1 million in the last 5 years. I've worked my ass off in this time to do that, extra gigs anytime I could, a few house flips, but I'm getting tired, and trying to sort out my end game, as it has always been the goal to FIRE, but not a clear number yet. I know that is on me though. 

My savings rate is healthy most months, saving around 8k or more usually, sometimes a lot more if I'm able to get some good paying extra work or flip a house, or car or something. At this point I'm not super strict with budgeting, but we are not extravagant either.

I've got few thoughts at this point. My original goal was to get ""enough"" income and do #1. I'd feel pretty comfortable doing that still, but I'm not sure it makes the most sense. I think I could wipe out that debt in 3 years, less if I sell my vacant land..

1. Do I focus on paying off the mortgages, and then after that is done call it ""done""? 

2. Do I keep the ""cheap"" debt, and try and grow the rentals more? Buy my complex? They are getting harder to find where they make sense to me. I'm REALLY picky about the numbers in a deal.

3. Do I keep the ""cheap"" debt and start putting the extra money into vanguard? 

4. Do I sell everything, except my home, and put that into the market (I don't think I could bring myself to do this, just throwing it out there.).

So things that worry me, healthcare..... That's my number one concern. Number 2 is my kids education, I never went beyond highschool, but I'd like them to have the chance to if they want it. I have 529's for them, but only about 8k in them right now. I'd like to get more in there while the income can easily handle it.

If I stop working I'd also like to easily afford domestic travel. We are good with extended camping type trips, nothing extravagant needed, but love the outdoors.

Any and all input is appreciated...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mailed a final 25k check to the bank today, my home is now paid off!

Single, no wife, no kids. NOVA/DC area. 

**FIRE Progress**: I feel a little bit guilty about this as I've not earned the vast majority of my assets. When I was born, my parents and both sets of grandparents regularly contributed to a trust for me (in fact, my parents contribute the max untaxed amount--$14K annually, I believe). The trusts allowed me to graduate from a good college debt free. I don't owe anything on my car and have no loans of any sort. I pay off my credit card in full every month. In other words, I'm completely debt free. 

My eventual goal is to have made enough cash in investments and whatnot that just sitting on my butt returns $100K/yr. I don't really know *why* I want that specific figure--maybe I played too many games of ""Life"" as a kid, but I feel that with $100K coming in annually I would have enough cash to do whatever I wanted and not have to worry about finances. I don't think I could spend $100K if I *tried.* And I don't think I'd stop working, but I do think I'd cut back some. I don't want to be a trust-fund kid, but I want a significant enough amount of money that I could live comfortably with a wife and two kids and give my offspring the same debt-free opportunities I've been given. 

I set up a goal in Mint with that in mind; I told it I wanted to retire at 68 with that figure. Now, according to Mint, my savings goal is $4,992,749. I still need $3,936,632 to hit that goal. It says I need to contribute $2,049 monthly to reach that goal. Given that I've got trusts and a money market account doing the heavy lifting (Mint says I contributed $34,687 this month which, you know, would be about half my annual salary), I'm significantly ahead of that: 19 years and 8 months ahead, in fact. I'd love it if I could somehow get that down to 10 years, but that would probably require insane QOL reductions on my part. 

**Gross Salary/Wages**: $75K. Employer had SEP IRA matching last year at 15% of base salary. IIRC, I was at $70K last year. 

**Yearly Savings Amounts**: I try to contribute the max to my ROTH every year. However, last year, I was told by my financial adviser and account that I'd earned too much in my trust and whatnot to pay into it. At the time, I had a bit of an excess in my checking account and had experimented with dumping $250/wk into my savings account. After I hit $10K in the savings account, I realized that cash was good as an emergency fund, but I wouldn't be making any extra cash from it. As such, my financial adviser set me up with a money market account. I used the same weekly transfer scheme for that account, which my financial adviser complimented me on the other day because it allowed me to frequently buy when things were down; the account grew at 14% last year.  

I had to cancel the transfer for the last few months due to some larger, out of the ordinary expenses. I'm planning to try resuming it soon once I've cut down on my food expenses. 

However, I've also got a pair of CDs coming due in the next few months of $6,605.09 and $5,070.51, respectively. After talking to my adviser, I'm going to put both of those into the money market account, as well. 

**Other Ordinary Income**: None. I occasionally do a speaking gig or two a year which pulls in a few hundred, but not enough for me to expect it to make a difference. I'm toying with the idea of starting up a side gig, but I still don't believe the pay would be tremendous; if I really worked at it, I might pull in a few thousand extra. I mean, it'd be in acting, which isn't known to bring in the cash even when you're doing it full time. 

**Current expenses**: I have a roommate in a complex with relatively stable rents. I'm putting in $916/mo. rent currently. I take monthly singing lessons at $200/mo., and I'm looking to take dance lessons regularly, as well (better health, balance, and it gets me out of the apartment). Internet is currently $60/mo. Gym membership is $30/mo. Electricity usage spikes in the summer to combat the humidity, but the roommate and I barely use the heater in the winter, when we once had a bill of $20. I subscribe to Spotify, which is an additional $10/mo. Otherwise, the largest expense for me every month is food, and I'm working to eat in more--I'm quickly becoming a master of Bird's Eye and Bertolli frozen bag dinners. Other purchases tend to be one-offs (suits, appliances, etc.; I'm not much for therapy shopping). 

From what I understand from my singing coach, if I'm able to earn something like $3K over a three-year period from acting jobs, I can start claiming the lessons as writeoffs on taxes. 

**Expected ER expenses**: None, though I've been fighting depression for a few years and I have been paying about $400/mo. in therapy, though I think I'm coming out of it somewhat.

**Assets**: The good market over the last year has allowed my trust(s) to grow to a total value of $988,845. I have a pair of SEP IRAs ($23,848 and $12,388, respectively), a pair of ROTH IRAs ($7,738 and $5,902), and a money market account ($18,433). My savings account sits at $11,532 and my checking account is currently hovering in the same area. If you roll my car's value into the mix (according to Mint, at least), my net worth is $1,116,288--again, according to Mint.  

**Liabilities**: None, thankfully. 

**Specific Question(s)**: Is there anything else I should be doing? Transferring the mature CDs into my money market account is the biggest financial decision I've made in some time; should I put all of that into my checking account and do weekly transfer of $1000/wk. for nearly three months? Or should I throw it all in there now? Should I be looking to make any more money in other ways or open some sort of other account?

Transferring the mature CDs into my money market account is the biggest financial decision I&amp;#39;ve made in some time; should I put all of that into my checking account and do weekly transfer of $1000/wk. for nearly three months? Or should I throw it all in there now? Should I be looking to make any more money in other ways or open some sort of other account? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

**Thank you so much for the very though-out replies. They really made me think.  I've decided what I'm going to do after reading your replies.**

1. **Talk to an adviser and make sure my numbers are correct. (sent out my numbers to one today)**
2. **Get my wife to retire ASAP. I think I would be happier if she were retired than if I were retired.**
3. **Set a definite retirement ""date"" (thinking 2019/early 2020 sometime).**
4. **Vow to donate whatever I make if I don't quit after my retirement date to the less fortunate (anonymously). That would be so enjoyable, and maybe put some meaning to my work.**
5. **Retire by 55.**

I am a 51 yo male who has been doing the EXACT SAME boring-ass and non-stressful job at the same company for 25 years (I've been with the same company for 30 years at various positions). There is nothing redeeming about my job as I basically work for “the Man”. Granted, things have changed a lot where I work, but my job has not. My wife (53) and I have two kids in college (paid for). She works full time as well. We have managed to accumulate 45 times our yearly expenses in various brokerage accounts, and 401(k)s. We have no debt. In addition to our savings, both of us have pensions that start paying out at 55 that accounts for 1/3 of our living expenses, so I guess at 55 our savings will be about 60x our living expenses.

I have attempted to quit twice, once with a formal resignation letter to my boss. Each time, I was offered a more-desirable package of “benefits” in order to entice me to stay. I now work from home full time, and get my work done each day in 4-5 hours, and get 42 days paid-time off each year.

I have many, many hobbies for all seasons that occupy my time outside of work. I should be happy as a pig in shit about my work situation, but I’m not.

I constantly have this conflict going on inside me. Part of me says “What the fuck are you working for dumbass!”, the other part of me says “Dude! Who the fuck would quit a situation like you have?” It kind of drives me nuts. I think about it often (TOO OFTEN!).

I think the problem I have is that there is no end in sight for me. . . stuck doing this boring-ass job, working for the “Man” forever. Maybe another issue I have is that I grew up in a lower-middle class household (when my Dad was employed and very poor for a couple of years when he wasn’t). I really do appreciate what I have. When I started this job, I had $20 in the bank.

We both had a good time, but came to the realization that our city (Kansas City), while a perfectly acceptable place to live, work and raise kids, wasn't going to cut it for our FIRE lifestyle. Anything we wanted to do was going to cost money, because there are few natural things to do.  



So we are considering moving once we FIRE, but then we thought, why wait that long. We figure we could save for a couple years in our current role while driving around Colorado and the pacific northwest looking for active, inexpensive places to live where we can bike, hike, kayak, camp and ski. Finding the perfect place means a good salary would probably not be available, so we might have to Coast FIRE for 10 years in order to get let our savings build.  



We are currently pulling in about 200K, if we do that for another 4 years or so, we should have 800K-1M saved, plus 300K in home equity. Then move to whereeversville, buy or build a modest home for 250-300K and find jobs to pull down about 75K combined while our savings go from 1M to 1.5M and we can be truly FI.   



So our choices are:


  
Work for about 10 years where we are at to get to FI.


  
Work for about 5 years where we are at, then ""build the life we want"" by moving to an ideal outdoorsy destination and COAST FIRE on location for another decade.  



Our daughter is a piece of this, moving with a 7 year old (in 5 years) seems like it wouldn't be a big deal. Uprooting a 12 year old on the other hand... yeesh.   



Thoughts? Also any recommendations for destination, so far we are thinking the Bend Oregon or Spokane WA area.

I moved to one of the more expensive cities almost 3 years ago. When I was deciding whether or not I should live in the city or out in the 'burbs, I did a cost benefit analysis. I determined living in the city would be slightly more expensive but worth a 10 minute subway vs a 1 hour drive. I also have health problems that made living in the city a better choice for me. 

##Benefit-Cost Analysis

Estimated Suburb Spending based on previous consumption rates in a LCOL city:

* Rent for 700 sqft apartment: $1,100
* Utilities: $150
* Food: $350 (groceries &amp; 
 eating out)
* Car Expenses: $400 (insurance,  gas, Maintenance) 
* Everything Else: $500
* Monthly total: $2,500

Assuming I would continue to eat and shop as usual, I estimated I'd spend $2.5k/ month if I decided to live in the suburbs.  

Estimated City Spending:

* Rent 400 sqft studio: $1,650 
* Utilities: $100
* Food: $350
* Shopping/Misc: $500
* Total: $2,600

Based on my estimations I thought I would spend $100 more. I would have to live in a studio to afford my lifestyle though. 

##Actual Spending

* Rent 400 sqft studio: $1,650 
* Utilities: $50
* Food: $200
* Shopping/Misc: $200
* Total: $2,100

I ended up saving $400 in comparison to living in the suburbs. I'm pretty certain my spending patterns would have remained unchanged if I had lived in the suburbs.

What happened? 

* Food: I stopped buying too much food at the grocery store. I only bought a few days worth of food since I couldn't carry much more. None of my food went to waste
* Utilities; Living in a studio (and an old building) cut down on utilities. 
* Elsewhere: I rarely visited stores and malls since there aren't many in my city and getting there was cumbersome.  Living in a studio also forced me to downsize and consider my living space.

My current budget is different than what I've shown above. I've since upgraded from a studio to a purchased condo so my housing costs are a lot higher. I also now budget to spend $200 more in non housing since my income has increased by 50% since I moved here.

34/M/US construction Engineer w/100k salary

This may seem like more of a rant than a solid post, apology’s ahead of time.  Also i know how this sub feels about real estate but that is not the basis of this post.

I discovered this sub a few months back and have been creeping around since. I’ve been working on my FI/RE plan for the last 5 years. I do have investment accounts but my main investments have been  in real estate as I’ve been getting deals with great cash flow that I can’t pass up. To be honest I am nearly FI already as my rentals bring in 50k a year self-managed and would probably cost 10-15k to have a manager handle everything.  My base expenses are approximately 30k (haven’t figured ou the Health insurance thing yet) I don’t’ have expensive taste but I do have hobbies I enjoy and the occasional weekend excursion.

I have a good job that pays well for my area and I don’t really mind the work, however it is in the city so the commute it a bit long I work about 55-60 hours a week including my commute, I do not want to move to the city I have a nice house in the county on 5 acres near my family that I bought in 2010 and has since tripled in value.

Real estate investing is a lot of work if you self manage but the returns can be amazing, not to mention the tax benefits ( I initially got into real estate for tax purposes after paying 50k in taxes on $120k profits as a small general contractor)  Starting out isn’t so bad but at some point it can get to be too much between the 7-5 job and managing the rentals. I just started delegating some of my rental workload as it got to be impossible  for me to do everything myself, but I’m easing into it slowly, many people say “just hire a property manager” but good managers that meet your expectations are hard to find and cut into your profits.

To get to the basis of the title, 

Last Thursday I got a call at 2:30 am. A hot water tank on of my buildings had its drain spigot blow off and water gushing all over the laundry/utility room. I had to run down shut the tank off, squeegee the water into the drain, set up a dehumidifier and fans and then leave to go to work at 5:30am.  Not the glamour you hear from all the so called real state “gurus” spouting how easy it is.

That day at work I received an email from the owner of a building I previously expressed interest in that was next some of my current properties, I was really interested in it but he was about 10% over the max i wanted to pay for it. He lives out of state and currently has a property manager that is just short of ripping him off (he’s had a vacancy in a 4 plex for 18 months, I own the 2 buildings next door and have a waiting list). He is looking to sell the building for 10% less than what I paid for mine or what i expected to pay for his. His building is in slightly better shape with rents already at market value and has lower expenses. When I got his email I was overcome with excitement at the opportunity to add to my portfolio such a great deal and began running the numbers.

Then it hit me.. I love this stuff, I haven’t been this excited in weeks, why do I want to retire early?

I end up realizing I love working, I love problem solving, being productive and seeing the fruits of my labors, I just don’t like seeing those fruits being a cog in the corporate wheel. I love being busy, having a to do list and the feeling of accomplishment I get, I believe its just in my personality and who I am. I was laid off for a few months and while it was nice to have some free time, it does get old. So I had to modify my FIRE plan.

I plan on getting some very important certifications in my field that my company will cover the expense on, once I receive the certifications i’ll start looking for a new job that is closer to my residence and outside the city, this will most likely result in a lower salary (75k as opposed to 100k) but only 40 hours a week so I will be freeing up 10-15 hours a week and will likely be less stressful, which  in my current situation is a good tradeoff. This would almost be considered a way to ease into RE as it’s a great reduction in my current workload (pretty much 

I will use this time to continue my real estate investing and continue maxing my 401k, IRA, HSA and making regular deposits into my personal investment accounts. I also have a few business ideas I’ve been wanting to get started on. 

My ultimate goal is a middle ground between Fat and Lean Fire (so i guess regular FIRE?) I live in a relatively LCOL area but I’d like to have a portfolio that will produce me 80-100K of which I can use 70k to live off of (the magic number for happiness supposedly) and still be able to grow the unused cash.  I’d still like to work 15-20 hours per week at my convenience on the business ventures I’ve been looking into but still have the ability to take a month for a trip whenever I feel the need. I like to travel, but I feel its over rated, I get more satisfaction out of having good personal relationships with people I care about than going and seeing things thousands of miles away. If when I turn 60 I want to just stop and snowbird myself to Florida I could pull out my retirement accounts and slowly liquidate my real estate holdings.

The financial implications of marriage and cost of raising children. Many here seem to be enterprising and hard working young-ish men who are either contemplating relationships or are currently in one and questioning whether they want to stay in it.

My thoughts on this are of an over 40 person who has been happily married for over 20 years. We are both frugal and plan to retire early. Here’s what I think – in your younger years – your 20’s and 30’s being single may not seem so bad. But many of you here don’t think past the money aspect of being over 40 and older. It doesn’t really matter how much money you saved up if you end up a lonely old man with no wife and kids. The value of a marriage is not just in regular (more or less) access to sex. It’s the companionship and bond you form with another human being. And if you have kids, well, try thinking of them past the first 18-20 years. Not many things make you as happy in your older years as watching your kids become adults, having a relationship with them, watching your grandkids grow up. 

And sure, you may not be able to FIRE as soon as you would have done as a single man, but make sure you think about what you’re going to do with all that free time if you remain single and childless. And sure, marriage doesn’t always work out. But that’s a whole other topic. Family is the only thing that matters more than FIRE, so make sure you’re thinking about where and who you want to be when you’re 50 and 60 and 70 and so on. 

**Edited in response to comments** I see people thinking about their finances in their older age, but not necessarily thinking about the people who will be in their lives at that older age – i.e. spouse, kids, grandkids. It’s good that you’re saving money when you’re young, but if you’re doing that at the expense of having a family, you might be shortchanging yourself. If you’re going to make a choice to forego family, make it with eyes wide open, and having weighed all the pros and cons. Most things that make your life worth living come with a lot of work and responsibility. Family definitely falls in that category.

**Edited some more in response to some more comments** Having family and getting married has risks and costs. Foregoing family to FIRE has different kind of risks and costs. Nothing has any guarantees in life, ever, no matter what you choose, but your chances of happy old age are statistically higher if you choose family. Both choices have risks. Your marriage can crash and burn and you could end up with looser kids. But you can also end up a rich and lonely old man who kills himself around Christmas time one year. Choose wisely, that’s all I’m saying. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of posts here about FIRE and relationships.

I've told her the 4% rule and how we can budget and probably not have to work that long, but I'd like some input from others with more experience, is this really possible for our situation?

We're both 25, currently living in KCMO (don't plan to stay here, but don't plan to live anywhere with a higher cost of living).  Currently we rent an apartment downtown and share a car.  I'd like to get somewhere cheaper when our lease is up and maybe start saving for a down payment once we decide where to settle down for a while.  It's also not a certainty whether we will ever have kids.

As far as debts go, I owe 20k on the 2014 model CUV we have, and she has about 6k in student loans along with an unwritten amount of repayment to her parents for getting her through school (this is great but also makes it tough).

We are both degree'd in pretty good fields; we're currently making about $100k gross income from the two paychecks.  I'm really not sure on potential but I have told my SO she doesn't have to seek professional licensure (architecture) and that  I can focus on being the more traditional ""bread earner"" (I'll be getting my engineering license in \~4 years).

So I started to layout some numbers and we currently spend about 3500/month all said and done, which doesn't feel super luxurious at all.  I've pitched the idea that we only need around 750k to retire if we can keep spending to around 30k/year.  However, when I say that she looks around and says I don't want to give up everything now just so we can retire early.  Travel is a big thing for her, both of us really, and I'd like to be sure and enjoy life while also preparing for FI/RE.

So basically I'm just sort of wondering if this is possible for us, retire around 45-50 years old and live on 35k/year with no kids?  I know a lot of that is just up to us and what we are willing to do spending wise, but most people I seem to see on here make a lot more money than we do so I'm kind of getting discouraged that maybe this is only possible for the people doing like software engineering and other extremely high paying jobs.

Edit: I should also add that retiring around 40-50 would still result in us working we would just probably be doing hobbies that don’t provide a steady income. But something like making furniture here and there, or flipping houses.

Edit 2: So I got the 35k/year from MMM and he’s got a kid. Maybe that’s not a realistic amount?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, been lurking for a while here.&lt;/p&gt;

A few years ago I met a woman and we started dating. She is amazing. Creative, playful, supportive, understanding. She makes me laugh so much and I feel great when I’m around her. After a series of relationships where I didn’t feel seen or wanted, its kind of a miracle.

Here’s the thing though. She’s 35 and her parents still pay her rent. As a former nanny and now a dog walker, she doesn’t earn much, and she also doesn’t seem motivated to work very hard. (Probably like 20 hours a week is her max, and then she feels too stressed out.)

We’ve been dating for about 2 years, serious for a year and a half of that. Almost a year ago I shared my plans for financial independence and told her how important it is to me that she learn to live within her means. She said she was going to work on it and even saved a couple thousand dollars but then she reverted back, spent her savings and started getting defensive when I brought it up.

Two years into the relationship, I am feeling like I need to make a decision. She is amazing and I love being with her.  But I can’t count on her to be a contributor for FIRE, and she might even be a liability. I don’t make much but I’m good at saving, and she isn’t a big spender but can’t get it together to break even.  Do I settle down and try to make it work or move on and try to find someone who is more compatible in this area?

**By the numbers:**

I make about 60k a year and save 2,400/mo. Between my 401k and VTSAX I’ve got about 110k. (Puts me on track for FI/RE in about 10 years). She makes enough to cover her living expenses but doesn't have health insurance or take vacations.  Her parents pay for her apartment (about $1200/mo). Neither of us have debt.

Its worth noting that her parents have offered to put a down payment on a house for us (50k max) and contribute to her savings. Neither of us are attached to having children, but it would be a shame if it wasn’t an option at all.

What do you think? Can I commit to this partner and still have the life I want or do I have to choose between them? 

Are these serious red flags or could we work as one of those relationships where I’m just the person who handles the money stuff? 

How do you talk to a new romantic partner about FI/RE when they aren't earning enough to cover their basic needs?

Problem is: I currently have one Roth IRA, and it is composed of:

- funds from non-roth, after-tax 401k (aka [mega backdoor roth](https://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/))
- funds from a non-deductible traditional ira (aka [backdoor roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth_IRA))

To my knowledge, the latter would not be protected from creditors since the funds didn't originate from an employer-sponsored plan. Also, I've only ever done the regular backdoor roth once.

The question: Is it going to be possible to split my existing assets based on their origin? I don't think retirement accounts use any cost basis, so you don't have [SpecID](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/guide/calculating-cost-basis) to identify which shares were purchased when. I also have reinvested dividends in the Roth IRA. Would it be possible to know which portion of the reinvestment came from employer-sponsored rollovers, and which portion from the traditional IRA rollover?

If possible, I think it'll be logistically easier to just move the Backdoor Roth IRA funds to a new Roth IRA (since all the dividends would be traceable to a single transaction-- the rollover from the traditional IRA). I took that $5,500 (well, it grew a little bit in the money market account), I bought 100% VFIAX with it, and I've received dividends once from VFIAX since that purchase.

I'm currently aggressively saving, aiming for RE.

I live in the UK, save 50% of my income, live frugally.

I would like to achieve RE through dividends.

I start to see popping YouTube videos claiming that you can live in ""poor"" countries for as low as 300/400$ per month.

Of course, I'm planning on gathering more information (cultural shock, language, health insurance, visa, security, etc.), give myself a bit of a leeway as well. 

I insist on the fact that I'm not (for now) looking for practical advice on how to live in such countries.

I'm, for now, more interested in the planning/feasibility phase, what are the basic maths behind such transition.

1. Is there a specific portfolio to have for this purpose?
2. What are the basic percentages to consider?
3. What should be the invested amount to aim for?
4. What about taxes on dividends that could reduce my profits?

This project will take me multiple years/decades to achieve, go through refinement.

For now, I'm focused on the basic formula, to plan, let's say:

    ((((invested * percentage) / 100) - taxes) / 12 months)

So I am 55 and have achieved all my goals towards FI. We are debt free with a net worth of over $2.2M. About half of that in stocks, a quarter in cash and laddered CDs, and a quarter in real estate investments and properties.  It is just my wife and I now and we have been tracking our expenses over the last couple of years. We can easily continue our present lifestyle on $35,000 per year, $30,000 if we cut back on some unnecessary expenses. We live simply and we raise much of our own food and I could do even more if I didn't have to work.  I have structured our finances to where we could weather just about any downturn in the markets. Even without social security we are well under a 2% drawdown rate and that doesn't include any of the passive income from the real estate. We are, as my dad would say, ""Shitting in high cotton.""

I have worked hard to get ourselves to this point where I could retire and focus on other things.  I am ready.  The problem?  I have realized that **I am a fucking coward.** I am *terrified* of taking that final step into retirement. Leaving my job would be a one-way trip. I have a good job that pays well, but it is a young man's game now and the only reason I am still here is because of my reputation for what I have done in the past. I could never come back into this field at the same level I am at.  I enjoy what I do for a living, but I am getting tired of the politics and trying to keep up with the new technologies. Much of what I know is outdated and will probably be totally obsolete in 5 years. My choices are to work even harder to catch up or walk away and do something more rewarding.  *Everything* is telling me that it is time to retire and focus on the things I want to do but I just can't seem to take that step. Whenever I think I have built up the courage to walk away, I hesitate and think of every single thing that could go wrong and slink away again with my tail between my legs.

I'm not even sure what I am afraid of to be honest. Fear of the unknown, I suppose. Fear of watching the numbers possibly start to go down instead of up. Fear of not being able to afford healthcare. Fear of having an ""oh shit"" moment where I realize that in spite of all of my planning I missed something important. I plan *everything* because I don't like surprises. I like predictability, and I suppose this is a leap of faith that all of my planning is good enough. But is it? What if I missed something? Even now the thought of retirement give me a sinking feeling in my stomach. Why, dammit, why?  Because when it comes down to it, I am a coward.

Sorry for the long boring post. This is screaming r/humblebrag I know. I don't mean for it to be. I am like a nervous bride having second thoughts just before walking down the aisle. I've done all of this planning, but have I done *enough*?  How do I get past this fear?  How do I learn to have faith that I have done things correctly?

How can I not be such a **fucking coward**?

Edit: All of you are **awesome**, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. This mass group therapy session has really helped me to see what the problem is, and it wasn't what I thought it was. I'm not afraid of running out of money. I'm afraid of losing an identity that I have spent decades building. I can already feel the fear dissipating as I come to grips with that. I have some deep thoughts to think on for the next month or so as I map out what post-retirement me looks like and how I, as someone put so eloquently, write the story that I want to become.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;New account because reasons, although I have been on this subreddit for years.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a good job that pays well, but it is a young man&amp;#39;s game now and the only reason I am still here is because of my reputation for what I have done in the past. I could never come back into this field at the same level I am at.  I enjoy what I do for a living, but I am getting tired of the politics and trying to keep up with the new technologies. Much of what I know is outdated and will probably be totally obsolete in 5 years. My choices are to work even harder to catch up or walk away and do something more rewarding.  &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; is telling me that it is time to retire and focus on the things I want to do but I just can&amp;#39;t seem to take that step. Whenever I think I have built up the courage to walk away, I hesitate and think of every single thing that could go wrong and slink away again with my tail between my legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even sure what I am afraid of to be honest. Fear of the unknown, I suppose. Fear of watching the numbers possibly start to go down instead of up. Fear of not being able to afford healthcare. Fear of having an &amp;quot;oh shit&amp;quot; moment where I realize that in spite of all of my planning I missed something important. I plan &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; because I don&amp;#39;t like surprises. I like predictability, and I suppose this is a leap of faith that all of my planning is good enough. But is it? What if I missed something? Even now the thought of retirement give me a sinking feeling in my stomach. Why, dammit, why?  Because when it comes down to it, I am a coward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long boring post. This is screaming &lt;a href=""/r/humblebrag""&gt;r/humblebrag&lt;/a&gt; I know. I don&amp;#39;t mean for it to be. I am like a nervous bride having second thoughts just before walking down the aisle. I&amp;#39;ve done all of this planning, but have I done &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;?  How do I get past this fear?  How do I learn to have faith that I have done things correctly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I not be such a &lt;strong&gt;fucking coward&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: All of you are &lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt;, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. This mass group therapy session has really helped me to see what the problem is, and it wasn&amp;#39;t what I thought it was. I&amp;#39;m not afraid of running out of money. I&amp;#39;m afraid of losing an identity that I have spent decades building. I can already feel the fear dissipating as I come to grips with that. I have some deep thoughts to think on for the next month or so as I map out what post-retirement me looks like and how I, as someone put so eloquently, write the story that I want to become.&lt;/p&gt;

Quick intro - I’m a 24y.o. guy living in London and starting a career in management consulting. I specialise in Innovation and emerging tech. While my line of profession pays really well, living in London is really expensive and it’s hard sometimes to be motivated to FIRE. I live a rather frugal lifestyle but I’ve still got a few weaknesses. 

I often read posts on this thread but they mostly come from experienced people that are well on their way to FIRE and I find it hard to relate. 

On the other hand, my peers aren’t that interested in investing, saving and living a frugal life, and I am reluctant to open up to them about this as they don’t seem to care about independence at all, while I’m looking to get out of the rat race ASAP.

I wanted to create a WhatsApp group for all people interested in FIRE but mostly millennial a like me who are at the start of their journey to inspire each other and provide advices/tips to one another.

Apologies if that already exists - I’ll see if that post get enough traction and create a group if people are interested.

Alternatively, I’d be really keen to connect with Londoners sharing this mindset!

Hey all, I'm about 2/3 the way though listening to the Mad Fientist's podcasts and I have a question about budgeting and safety nets before I start to pour the remaining savings into whole market index funds.

Based on a monthly budget of $2600 dollars, I'd like a safety net of $30K which is a rounded amount of our monthly expenses for a year if my spouse and I were to lose our jobs. Alternatively it would also be there in case of a catastrophic expense. We are both government contractors living in the DC area so the chance is slim that we would both be without jobs. **Rather than the 30K just sitting there, what is the FI approach to working this money?** I was thinking having 10K cash on hand(checking/savings) would be useful for emergency home expenses and investing the remaining 20K in bonds just to prevent depreciation and not be a risky investment (VBTLX). **What is your strategy and why?**

Insert question. 

I just met with a financial advisor and she talked to me about whole life insurance. And to keep it basic, she ran models for me to where I would put half my savings each year into whole life insurance and the other half into other investment vehicles (the market or real estate or whatever I choose). 

She basically said that when the markets downturn, you start pulling from the whole life policy instead of your active investments. Literally all the models she ran made perfect sense, and if I die my spouse still gets my life insurance benefit. The life insurance gains like 4% per year and is pretty much guaranteed. And since I’m 30 and healthy, the premiums aren’t ridiculous on a large policy. 

All in all, the models allow you to pull out a hell of a lot more than 4% (somewhere like 6-8%) because they don’t have a chance of portfolio failure from the safety/security of the life insurance policy. Basically it takes less money to retire because you’re able to take out higher percentages.

My wife and I have turned our eyes to the ""what's next"" portion of our lives. I'm 40, she's 36, and we are looking to start dialing back on working so many hours per week. Not retiring for years to come, yet, but more do something less stressful, sooner than later. I think that's labeled CoastFIRE? Anyhow, We are finally in a fortuitous position and knuckling down hard on our savings. We have zero debt. Own both cars, own our home free and clear, no loans. We pay for everything with a rotation of 3 rewards cards, depending on what 5% bonus each have activated for a given quarter, and those are immediately paid in full, monthly. 

Current savings/portfolio look like this:

My 401k - 113k

Her 401k (Sitting from a previous job) - 75k

Investments (Split between a managed account and our own Vanguard) - 37k

I got a very late start in taking full advantage of my company's 401k match, and this will be the first full year that I max out my contribution. It will stay maxed, going forward.

We have a combined income of just under 200k, gross, and our monthly expenses are under 2k. We are pretty boring. Don't go out much, I love to cook, so that's a no brainer. We figured that, after taxes, we can easily stow away 78k annually, minimum. 102k by really cranking on it, which will be the goal each year. 48k of that minimum will go to the managed account and the rest (including the max of 54k) will go in to our newly opened Vanguard brokerage. Currently Vanguard is only the initial 11k in VTSAX, but we will be expanding that to include international in the next month. 

I know we are late to the game, but with our low expenses and high savings rate, are we crazy to think that we can generate a lumpy enough egg to take a step back and breathe a bit, work level-wise, in say 5ish years?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey gang,&lt;/p&gt;

Tools like cFireSim are available for looking at FI from a cash in vs. cash out perspective, but after spending so many hours reading EarlyRetirementNow's many-part research on SWR, I'd love to assess my own SWR! 

However, once one moves from having a pure stock/bond portfolio to have actual alternative investments, it becomes harder to account for the various sources of income. It then becomes more individualized. However, I have a feeling I’m not the only one playing with my FI spreadsheet and struggling with incorporating real estate.

My discussion topic today is accounting for income &amp; the asset of rental properties with mortgages. The simplest way I’ve read is not to include asset in the denominator of your WR division, and simply subtract net rental income from living expenses, and the remainder of expenses is divided by stock portfolio = Withdrawal rate percentage. However, with a mortgage on the property, this simplified calculation is in my opinion too conservative, as it does not account for (1) the principal paydown from the mortgage payment and (2) price appreciation of the house.

Regarding (1), it is true that having extra equity in the house does not improve returns at all. After all it doesn’t improve your net income, and it doesn’t make the house appreciate more. Although withdrawing from your stock portfolio to add more home equity is a reduction in the return of your overall portfolio, it’s not a true expense since it’s net worth neutral. 

\---An initial thought was to add back the principal paydown portion of the mortgage to my expenses ( if I had $20k of expenses after accounting living expenses less net rental income, but I paid $8k of principal on the mortgage that year, then my actual expenses numerator for WR % is $12k). However, I believe this incorrect as that $8k was taken out of my stock investments, where it returns say 8%, to pay the mortgage, and put into equity where it returns 0%.

\---The way I’m leaning to is to look at the rental property as just a type of stock. Just like with stocks the dividend income isn’t relevant to the SWR %, I could simply not include the rental income in that calculation. As such the calculation would be living expenses, with no adjustment for rental income / (stock portfolio + equity in rental).

&lt;p&gt;My current plan for FIRE involves building a significant income stream from P2P lending on LendingClub and Prosper. Is anybody else here taking that route? Are the results as good as they claim?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across this analysis of LendingClub that alleges systematic bias in favor of hedge funds: &lt;a href=""https://medium.com/@jr.willett/dont-just-auto-invest-proving-systematic-bias-at-lendingclub-c9a9122ec8c1""&gt;https://medium.com/@jr.willett/dont-just-auto-invest-proving-systematic-bias-at-lendingclub-c9a9122ec8c1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m wondering if maybe small fries like me should look elsewhere for a steady FIRE income stream. That article basically claims that the hedge funds eat people like me for lunch when we dabble in P2P lending. What do you guys think? Is this still a workable way to FIRE?&lt;/p&gt;

I currently live in Europe, expat student in the Netherlands with no work experience besides

\- A Silicon valley internship, but being paid a scholarship well below minimum wage in California.

\- 5 Summers as a part time lifeguard in my hometown

Currently, I am finishing my master thesis in mechanical engineering and I am struggling VERY badly with motivation to work or pursing my dream of a fulfiling scientific career.

I have always been able to provide for myself without help from parents (at least since I was 18, which is not common in my country).

\- I house-hacked my student flat thus never had to pay rent (I still sublease it to this day for 700€ profit a month)

\- I got sholarschips for the first 3 years of study which covered tuitions and more (3000€ a year)

\- I buy, repair, flip second hand items. Actively look for part time jobs and money on the side.

\- During the internship, I slept in a minivan and invested all extra dollars into bitcoin (Setember 2017)

\- I actively invest, trade and flip bitcoin on the street.

My net worth is

\- 8k in Crypto ( 5k is my euro cost average for bitcoin, 3k profit currently)

\- 5k pending ""assets?"" (scholarship, 2x student housing deposits, and items I plan to sell such as bikes and computers)

\- 1.5k cash

My main struggle is motivation. My parents/family are retired early and run Bnbs, have a cottage by the beach they are restoring, and live a fulfiling life in an island. Part of me just wants to join them. The other part of me, wants to work hard and pursue an academic career in switzerland and save as much as I can towards early retirement.

I am minimalistic and frugal, but always hungry for easy money. I want to find the motivation to pursue my dreams and continue with a PHD or research fellowship. But working on this master thesis feels like a huge burden and really wears me down and makes me escape into the easy money-frugal lifestyle dreams/route.

On the short term, I plan on doing an budget european bike tour. Get my head of school after I finally graduate. After that, I want to convert a cargo van and live minimalistically while saving as much as possible from my first job in order to invest into real estate at my hometown and start profiting of vacation rentals.

I have a 40 hour a week job around 100K salary pre-tax. 200K'ish in 401K. Paid off car. Two houses &amp; mortgages. 

one house is an airbnb netting me around 2-3K profit per month.

No outstanding debt besides the mortgages. 

What I'm really curious about is what I should be doing to keep momentum going on becoming financially independent. 

I live a pretty pricey lifestyle that I'm not ready to give up on just yet. But am open to ideas on how to stop going out to eat/drink so much. 

Once my renovations are complete on the second house and I'm renting it, I'm not for sure what to do next. Do I buy another house and rent? Invest? Open a McDonalds? Go live in cheap property in the woods and never deal with money again? 

I fully expect to be working for another 10 years, but would like to stop working salaried day jobs after that. I'm not opposed to doing other various work, but I want incredibly flexible time.

I currently get health insurance via my employer for a $500/month premium plus another \~$200/month in out of pocket expenses due to group rates and my employer paying most of the premium. If I had to buy health insurance privately, I expect it could cost me upwards of $50K to insure my self and family if I'm able to get insurance at all (have pre-existing conditions).

The company stock seems to have never really experienced much loss in value, so I'm planning to hang onto it, not cash it out.

My current plan is to max out the employee stock purchase program at 10% of my pay and then also put about 10% (+ 3% employee match) into the 401k. I'm currently set to invest my 401k options into the following funds: 63% in VIIIX, 27% in VWILX, and 10% in VBMPX.

Here are some questions I was hoping you could help me answer:

1. Are my 401k choices reasonable? Any suggestions around my choices? Any other Vanguard 401k funds I should consider?

2. My 401k contributions will equal about half the total yearly 401k contribution cap. Should I consider lowering what I'm dedicating to the employee stock purchase program so I can put that towards my 401k to lower my tax burden, or should I take the employee stock purchase option since it comes with a 15% discount on the stock price? I feel like I'm leaving money on the table if I don't take full advantage of the stock purchase program discount, but I'd love to hear other opinions on this choice.

I'm 36M with net worth of 1.5M (I'm somewhat invested in crypto so it fluctuates quite a bit, but that's a fair average).  High income earner currently able to put away about $100k per year towards FIRE.  I'd like to quit my current job and become either a part or full-time computer science professor in the next 6-8 years.  I'm looking to do a relatively fat fire of between $160k and $200k per year (lifestyle inflation is hard to get out of..).

I ran all the numbers thru firecalc and came up with a lot of different scenarios.  Here's my spreadsheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15HTWOTYaaIzXhaZq3dKGRcvSKoEAxWvm0VGWYrtjv2o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15HTWOTYaaIzXhaZq3dKGRcvSKoEAxWvm0VGWYrtjv2o/edit?usp=sharing)

Am I even using firecalc correctly?

According to firecalc if I keep working until 2026, saving $100k per year, and then earn $70k per year between teaching and passive income that I'd be able to have an 85.2% chance of FIREing successfully while living on $200k per year.  Or I could work until 2024 and then live on $180k with essentially the same success rate.

The other firecalc result that seems really attractive to me is living on $160k, having $30k/yr of teaching/passive income, and having 87% chance of success.

Is this realistic?  I need to know if I'm missing something major.  I suppose if there's a major recession in the next few years it could really set me back.  Not sure what else I should be thinking about.

I'm pretty new this all, please help :)

Long time lurker but made an account because I'm seeking advice.

I know that some people in this community talk about using FIRE as a means of pursuing better things in life, and that is exactly what I am trying to achieve. I am a 22 M living in a LCOL area in the Midwest. I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree and recently finished my first full year of working at my company. The job environment is great; I feel challenged when I go into work and my boss has become a great mentor............but I can't help feeling like my career is meaningful.

Ever since I was a freshman in college it's been a dream of mine to teach high school Physics. I'm gifted at communicating with people, I've tutored so many of my friends throughout school, and I get an absolute rush from helping people understand something complicated or technical that they couldn't before. Most important, I want to help make my community a better place, and I honestly can't think of a way that better applies my skill set than teaching. However, my dad was a teacher, and since he didn't marry a high income earner (mom never got her college degree), we were hard stuck in the lower middle class. We didn't live paycheck to paycheck, but my dad was so frugal it freaked me out about money. When I told him I wanted to be a teacher in high school he basically said, ""Teachers don't make enough money. I regret being one, it's not what you think it's going to be.""

At this point, however, my mind is made up. I am my own person, and I want to teach. But how should I proceed when I know teacher pay is terrible? Should I grind through a career I'm already losing interest in for another 10 years and build up a nest egg? Or should I bank one year worth of salary for FU money and make the jump? Do I put it all in the Roth/retirement vehicles and let it grow or just build a pile of FU money? I also want to have a family and kids at some point and I don't want to instill in them the fear of money I had growing up.

My financial snapshot is as follows:

**Salary:** $50,000

**401k:** $7,900 (only eligible to start contributing in December of last year)

**Emergency fund:** $7,200

**Roth:** $5,600

**Current monthly expenses:** $1,600

**Outstanding debt:** 0 (I worked hard and got lucky here, no student loans, no mortgage, no current car payments)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi FIRE community,&lt;/p&gt;

I realized this because one day at work my boss told me if you finish this before noon you can go home. and it was the moment I was the most motivated to do something my entire life and on the way back home at 12h10 I was sitting in my car wiht a freaking HUGE smile on my face.

This is when i discovered that my passion was simply NOT WORKING and being at home gaming/watching tv/with friends/relaxing/reading a book/walking/etc.   All thing that don't pay anything as a career.  So I started to read about Financial independance, leanfire, FIRE, early retirement. and this is when it ""Clicked"" I don't want to find a job I am passionate about but a job that bring good money and that offer a lot of free time/vacation/flecibility/work from home/etc. so I can enjoy my time at home more.

Finaly I decided to become an industry accontant for a really good green energy company, that offered me 5weeks vacation for my 1st year, they offer to bank my Hours at 1.5rate in overtime, I can arrive whenever I want, I cna leave whenever I want as long as I do my 37.5h/week.  Job is not stressfull, and I like playing in Excel.

Honestly, I make decent money, my goal is once I make a bit more and I have a bit more saved, I'll ask for less hours, maybe a 35h/week or maybe a friday off every 2nd friday, or maybe all my friday afternoon.  Otherwise I might ask for 1 day/week with work from home.

My endgame goal is to work the minimum requried hours to keep my permanent status, I've asked HR and here ist 32.5h/week to keep permanent status.   thats the dream.   Imagine starting your work shift at 7H00 and finishing at 13h30 EVERYDAY THE WHOLE YEAR !! and by then I will have 6 weeks vacation, and I will probbaly take 2 weeks at christmas, 2 weeks in summer vacation, and I will spread the other 2 other weeks to get like all my wednesday off.  This way I would only work 2days in a row maximum and those day will only be from 7h00 to 13H30... image all the free time I will have!!

I'm 47 years old, a physician that went through a brutal divorce in 2010 (was about a 1 million+ networth hit, which decimated me).   Slowly have built myself back up and now have a 7 figure networth which has been producing some nice passive income streams through real estate holdings, etc.

I have 1 daughter who is 12 years old.

My longterm girlfriend who I do plan on marrying has 2 adult children of her own.

We both have discussed prenuptials and I believe she is on board with it.

I have a fully paid for home as well which I plan to leave to my daughter when I pass (but will likely have to set up a trust to allow my then wife to stay until she passes).

Achieving FIRE close to or even slightly after marriage makes for interesting topic and not sure if anyone else has been in this situation but if all my income is from assets produced prior to marriage would the courts automatically put them in my balance sheet if God forbid there is a divorce?

Any other steps that people suggest in negotiating through this delicate process?

Here’s the details.

Life Situation: Married, 37, filing jointly, three dependents, 32, 8, and 6. I’m the sole earner and anticipating it being that way at least until my retirement which coincides with our oldest graduating HS.  

FIRE Progress: Halfway there.  Need another 9 yrs in the military to retire.  I plan on retiring at or very near 20 yrs unless things go south between now and then.  If that were to happen I would suck it up and do a couple more yrs. 

Gross Salary/Wages: ~ 100k, not including housing allowance since that changes depending on where I’m stationed.

Yearly Savings Amounts: max out mine and wife’s Roth IRAs, TSP fluctuates, but planning on 13k this year, maxed last yr though, brokerage account ~13k or so, 5k the year prior.  1,800 a yr in 529s for each kid.  For the sake of questions and for calculating FV assume I’m doing these same amounts each yr.

Rental Income, Actual Expenses, and Depreciation: Have a house we are renting out, but just using it to capture equity.  It doesn’t figure in to my retirement other than selling it in 9 yrs and using the money for a down payment where we retire.  

Current expenses: Roughly speaking they are about ~60k a yr for everything including rent.  We did good with a budget two duty stations ago, but need to get back on it.  I feel like I can lower this to possibly 50k or 55k and not even notice a drop in quality of life.

Assets: 
-125k in Roth IRAs, 75k in mine (turn 59.5 in 2040) and 50k in wife’s (59.5 in 2045).  
-100k in TSP that I can tap in 2040 as well.  In the TSP about 40k is traditional and 60k is Roth with future contributions all going Roth.  
-25k between brokerage and lending club.  I’m no longer buying new loans or putting new money in LC and moving it all to brokerage account.   
-30k in home equity  
-20k emergency fund for house repairs and what have you.  

All of holdings for IRA and brokerage are Vanguard’s Target Retirement 2050 (VFIFX) and for TSP it is L 2050.   

I also don’t have any life insurance other than SGLI, but recently quit tobacco so was going to wait until I didn’t need to report it in the app process.  Planning on adding that next month (1 yr no tobacco, yay)

Specific Question(s): It dawned on me this year that if I truly want to retire in 9 yrs that I need something to bridge the gap between military retirement and being able to use money in all our retirement accounts.  It is roughly 12 yrs to bridge best (worst) case scenario.  Hence, the brokerage account.  I est my pension can cover ~75% of retirement expenses, so the brokerage would be used for that remaining 25%.  I see a lot of advice saying to max TSP or 401, but I would rather put that money into the brokerage and use that during the first yrs of retirement to get me to 59.5.  I’ve also seen 72t mentioned a bunch and other methods.

Looking at the FV of all my accounts everything looks good for 59.5 and the brokerage will be at ~250k when 47.  This is the crux of the plan.  

Any thoughts about what you all would do differently and what I’m I missing?  Specifically would you max the TSP before putting money in a brokerage and why?  Would you do a mix of traditional and Roth for TSP or just one or the other?  Would you change my holdings?  Allocate manually on your own to get the lower ER for Admiral shares?  Would you allocate more to the brokerage to cover the gap more effectively?  Not looking forward to paying taxes on the brokerage every yr, but if it means no more work after the military than it’s a small price to pay.

If the US were to enact a single payer healthcare system, where all care is covered via taxpayers/goverment, how would this change the retirement planning landscape.

Many Americans would have HSA's, FSA's, etc with large amounts of savings. If you were to speculate, what could happen to that money? How would the government handle this? Is there precedent in other countries that have adoped a single payer healthcare system?

Furthermore, how would this change your plans for FI/RE? Healthcare is probably the number one biggest expenditure in old age and retirement.

I currently drive a 2004 WRX, which only gets driven one day a week at best (I take public transportation), usually to some car event. I've had the car 6 years and it has 140k miles, with rust forming. I have my eyes on a 2017 BRZ, going for about $26k + taxes and fees. I could probably sell the WRX for $8k. I'd have to drop $20k of savings on the new car or finance it at around 3&amp;#37; and keep the $20k to hopefully make more than 3&amp;#37; on it.

I'm REALLY passionate and geared to hit FI as soon as possible. I know by using $20k right now, it would set me back. On the other hand, I REALLY love cars and I'm fairly certain this new car would bring me a ton of joy. It's a car I've followed the development for when it was announced and never thought I'd have the chance to buy one within the next 10 years.

Part of my brain says it's a measly $20k, everyone buys new cars, it'll hold it's value decently. Then the other half is dreading seeing the $20k reduction in my portfolio and knowing I'm setting myself back a few years from an early retirement. I see other people I race and hang out with dropping $50k+ on new cars without even thinking.

**Serious question: How do any of you justify new major purchases?** I've never bought anything larger than $8k before for the previous car and that was with a $4k sale on the previous car.

Anyhow, I won't get too detailed about the job. It was a very weird work situation, super disorganized company...

Anyhow, they are paying me for another month, and technically on my contract my last day is next month, which gives me some time to regroup.

Am I understanding this correctly? Are there any alternate options to consider?**

----

Based on some answers here, it's starting to look like there's a good chance once my wife and I retire, we can pay little to nothing in U.S. taxes based on our situation. We will have (I hope) eventually close to $700-800k  in a brokerage account, and perhaps $200k+ in tax deferred retirement accounts. The suggestion one Redditor here gave was:

- Once early retired, each year convert $24k from tIRA or 401k/457b to Roth. Pay no taxes due to $24k married filing jointly exemption. Don't touch that Roth money for the 5 years necessary. 
- Withdraw $40k/yr (or less, maybe 5k less) from brokerage account to live on.
- Do tax gain harvesting of the remaining $37k in the 77k LTCG 0% tax bracket.

Sounds good. That means within about 15 years, so by age 65 or so I guess, we may have converted all our retirement money to Roth without paying any taxes on it and ""re-basis'ed"" our brokerage money significantly. I'm also not paying any taxes on the LTCG money. So we'd be not paying any federal taxes at all, correct?

(This is not as much working the system as it may sound when you realize that we failed to take advantage of tons of tax savings earlier in life when we had no idea what we were doing. We've paid in a lot of taxes that we didn't have to, so I guess that's part of our civic contribution.)

OK, now here comes the catch: My wife is from Spain, and would sure like to live there at some point. I'd be up for that, too. Now this is where the plan takes a concerning turn... There are really four issues:

**1. Long Term Capital Gains.** I'm under the impression that if we live in Spain, our Long Term Capital Gains (from the U.S. stock market) actually *will* be taxed, and not favorably ([source](https://www.blevinsfranks.com/news/blevinsfranks/article/capital-gains-tax-spain)):

&gt; In 2017, residents pay tax on savings income progressively at 19% (€0-€6,000), **21% (€6,000-€50,000) and 23% (over €50,000).**

So that seems to me, if living in the U.S., we could realize $77,000 in LTCG and pay $0 in taxes on it, ever. If we do that while residents in Spain, we'd pay about $16,590 in taxes on it. I get that from assuming Euros are the same value as dollars, and applying those brackets like so:

&gt; ($6,000 * 19%) + ($44,000 * 21%) + ($27,000 * 23%) = $16,590.

**2. Roth.** Plus, worse, the $24,000 in Roth conversion would, I think, be obviated because once we take that Roth money out as a distribution, *that too* would be taxed (as ordinary income?), whereas in the U.S. it would never be taxed again. This part I am unsure about because there is a U.S./Spain tax treaty that does at least mention 401ks and so forth, but I haven't read it carefully yet.

**3. Inheritance.** I'm due about 100-150k inheritance. Spain has an inheritance tax; I don't yet know whether there are exemption amounts. I'm hoping I just get this before we even move there, so this isn't much of an issue for us, but it's dependent on the sale of a property, so if that drags out for years, it could be a problem.

**4. Wealth tax.** Last, Spain currently has a ""wealth tax"", where you are taxed on your total wealth--not income, the money you have. For a married couple, there is currently a $700k each exclusion, so that would allow us $1.4 million in wealth before any taxes kick in. THey also allow $300k each for your primary home, if we owned one there. All of which might be more than enough to not have to worry about that. 

I know there is a Foreign Tax Credit from the U.S. that we could take for the taxes paid to Spain and apply that credit to future taxes owed...but would it be any use to us if we would not be paying U.S. taxes anyway? 

In order not to be considered tax residents in Spain, we would have to not live there for ~183 days a year. I'm thinking of being 65+ and being forced to fly back and forth the Atlantic twice a year, both of us, in order to not worry about this tax issue (and have a domicile to go to each time!) and it seems like a real drag. I know these trips and the disruption of finding a flight, settling in on the other country, etc., can sometimes be a pain. Also, I was thinking that maybe we should retire in Spain fully when we're older (70+), since I prefer their healthcare system to the U.S. system in terms of financial effects and just pure hassle. 

So, I'd like to make sure I'm understanding the situation correctly before making any long term plans.


","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Our situation seems like it allows us to pay no federal taxes once we early retire--&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we stay in the U.S. If we early retire abroad to Spain, it seems like we&amp;#39;ll pay a lot more in taxes. Am I understanding this correctly? Are there any alternate options to consider?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on some answers here, it&amp;#39;s starting to look like there&amp;#39;s a good chance once my wife and I retire, we can pay little to nothing in U.S. taxes based on our situation. We will have (I hope) eventually close to $700-800k  in a brokerage account, and perhaps $200k+ in tax deferred retirement accounts. The suggestion one Redditor here gave was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once early retired, each year convert $24k from tIRA or 401k/457b to Roth. Pay no taxes due to $24k married filing jointly exemption. Don&amp;#39;t touch that Roth money for the 5 years necessary. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdraw $40k/yr (or less, maybe 5k less) from brokerage account to live on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do tax gain harvesting of the remaining $37k in the 77k LTCG 0% tax bracket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds good. That means within about 15 years, so by age 65 or so I guess, we may have converted all our retirement money to Roth without paying any taxes on it and &amp;quot;re-basis&amp;#39;ed&amp;quot; our brokerage money significantly. I&amp;#39;m also not paying any taxes on the LTCG money. So we&amp;#39;d be not paying any federal taxes at all, correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is not as much working the system as it may sound when you realize that we failed to take advantage of tons of tax savings earlier in life when we had no idea what we were doing. We&amp;#39;ve paid in a lot of taxes that we didn&amp;#39;t have to, so I guess that&amp;#39;s part of our civic contribution.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now here comes the catch: My wife is from Spain, and would sure like to live there at some point. I&amp;#39;d be up for that, too. Now this is where the plan takes a concerning turn... There are really four issues:&lt;/p&gt;

Me: Early twenties, work in sales, moved to a small Midwest city in January.

House shopping at the moment, I plan to rent out one of the spare bedrooms. Plan on moving to the east coast in ~5 years (closer to friends and family).

Income: $64k salary, approximately $4k bonus. 
No commission, which I prefer for the stability. Fair amount of upward mobility, I could likely make ~$80k before I move. Company car.

Spending: I have been tracking my spending using Mint, so we’ll get pretty close to real numbers. All of the below are per month.
Rent: $900 (single apartment)
Utilities: $60
Shopping: $130 (books, clothing, Walmart)
Food: $550 (includes eating out, groceries, booze)
Gym: $50
Charity: $100
Other: $250 (gas, insurance, race fees, etc)
Most of this is put on a credit card, which is paid off every month (1% back baby!).

Investments: 20% into Roth 401k. Full match for first 3%, half match for 2nd 3%.  Balance $12k. 
$75/week invested into Acorns account. Balance $5k.

Assets: motorcycle worth ~$4k.  $21k in the bank, about $10k of which will go towards down payment/closing costs.

I've been a lurker on r/personalfinance and r/financialindependence for quite some time now and first of all I want to say thank you for the amazing community to learn from. I've read through all the FAQ's, and especially took interest in in the madfientist post for Traditional vs Roth. However many of the articles I read say that for high income you can argue that you could contribute to Traditional and then utilize a Roth conversion ladder down the road. Others claim to go right for a  Roth contribution because we may see higher income tax rates in the future considering when you look at historical data over the past 40 years we are in a very low bracket and there's no guarantee that by the time I'm 60 our taxes won't be crazy high.

A little background - 24M living in South Carolina for LCOL. I'm been very fortunate to have studied engineering and get into tech sales. Currently making $110k base and $40k commissions (10% variation y/y on commission). I don't have any crazy short term RE goals - probably targeting early 50's. The main goal like everyone else is to just have FI so there's no stress. 

  
Growing up my Dad always taught me Roth is the best way to go and he wishes he had Roth as an option when he was my age. However, I think my income has grown past the point of sticking it all in Roth and wiping my hands clean.

* Irrational behavior by myself during a market downturn. I am a bit of a spaz and shoot from the hip in most areas of life and have never had any assets during a recession.
* Tax efficiency. I don't have the time to manage it effectively.
* Drawdown strategy in retirement. I am not super comfortable implementing one.
* Estate planning/insurance, I know I need to do these things and having someone make me do them would be helpful.

Has anyone developed a spreadsheet or calculator to track your tax burden on your brokerage account? Or is there a place I could access this within Vanguard?

I'm primarily invested in VTSAX and VWITX in my brokerage and curious how my taxes would be affected after account significantly increases in value (100k plus)

Maxed out everything I could (401k, Roth, HSA), so debating if it makes more sense to go all brokerage or after tax 401k for IRR/MegaBDR. Realize the consensus is brokerage is preferred for ER, but wanted to crunch numbers for myself.

Thanks for any help!

It's been 2 years so I thought people might like an update as the FIRE goal gets closer. Basically, the market has been very helpful and we’ve continued our savings regimen.  The dual military route to FIRE is a great option, but I will say it’s not easy.  Deployments and work schedules make it difficult when you have kids.

My goal remains to have $2m in net worth plus our military pensions and retire at age 43.

**Current Ages:**

* Me: 37yrs
* Wife: 35yrs
* Kid 1: 5yrs
* Kid 2: 2yrs

**Income:**

* Me: $125k
* Wife: $119k  + $15k bonus for the next 2 years

Our incomes went up a bit (+40k plus 15k bonus) due to a combination of cost of living increases, a promotion, a retention bonus my wife qualified for (payable over 4 years), and a higher housing allowance for moving to a much higher cost of living area.

Rental Property: $1900/mo rent, $190 management fee, $1367.68 mortgage, $90 HOA. This ends up being an extra $250 in cashflow with $850 of the mortgage payment going to principle or a net $1100/mo. We owe $59k (3.25%) on the 15 yr mortgage and the house is worth about $290k. (Purchase price: $215k + $20k repairs/improvements).  Continuing to pay the mortgage as scheduled results in paying off the mortgage when we retire.

Savings: Both wife and I max out our tax deferred savings options. We also put $2300/mo into the taxable brokerage account, Traditional TSP ($18.5k/yr each), and Roth IRA ($5.5k/yr each). Total annual savings is $88,600 when I add everything up. The vast majority of these investments are in extremely low cost index funds. 

**Current balances:**

* TSP (gov’t 401k): $618k  (242k increase, 168k gains, 74k contributions)
* Roth IRAs: $195k  (70k increase, 48k gains, 22k contributions)
* Taxable brokerage account: $165k  (10k decrease, took out $100k for down payment which wiped out contributions/gains over the last 2 years)
* Emergency fund: $15k
* Checking: $15k
* Kid 1 ESA: $17k (8k increase, 4k gains, 4k contributions)
* Kid 2 ESA: $7.5k (5.5k increase, 3.5k gains, 4k contributions)

Still have the same 2 cars (2008 and 2013), decided not to upgrade to a bigger model with the second kid.  

Life insurance: No change in policies, $145/mo combined for both our policies.  We each have $1m which will drop in half to $500k when we retire and the work insurance goes away.  The $500k policies are 30 year term that take us to around age 63.

The big expense change came from buying a house last year..  Ended up buying a $497k house with a conventional mortgage w/20% down.   We owe $384k @ 3.75%.  We plan to keep this one as a second rental property when we move in a few years to a new assignment.  I estimate owing about $300k on this when we retire.  The house is worth $510-540k or so and should rent for around $2600-2900.

**Expenses:**

Expenses are pretty similar, the main differences was the new mortgage payment $2431.49 and our daycare costs went way up from $1256/mo to $2200/mo.  Mostly from moving to a daycare place off base in a higher cost of living area and much more convenient to our home location.  We did away with cable tv, but everything else is pretty much the same.

* Fixed expenses (mortgages, day care, insurance, utilities, etc): $7551/mo
* Fixed savings: $7384/mo

Extra money left in checking account each month is about $3-4k which ends up going to fixing up the house, trips, extra mortgage payments, or more often just transferring it to the brokerage account.  The new house required a bunch of work like new HVAC, windows, etc, and it still needs a new roof sometime soon.  So, that’s been a focus the house has definitely improved in value due to these repairs.

**Historical Actual Net Worth:** https://i.imgur.com/Dum6Kij.jpg

* 2012: +$130k
* 2013: +$194k
* 2014: +$110k
* 2015: +$39k
* 2016: +$177k
* 2017: +$247k
* 2018: +$104k year to date

**Historical Actual Debt:** https://i.imgur.com/mLfMwex.jpg

Military pensions are equal to 2.5% * yrs of service * high 3 base pay avg. So, 20 years = 50% of your base pay. Based on our expected rank at retirement, this would be $54k each. That is in today’s money and since this is tied to inflation it’d be slightly higher (6 years from now) and would continue to grow each year in retirement since it’s chained to the CPI.

**Retirement plan:**

Age 43:

1) Buy a nice house somewhere with cash ($400k range) after selling the rental houses.  We really don’t know yet where this will be and how much we’d spend.  It might be worth keeping the rental houses as income or doing a 1031 transfer to get a new rental investment property.  

2) Stop TSP/Roth IRA contributions, consider rolling over the traditional TSP into the Roth accounts as needed if we need access to this money before age 59.5

3) Live off of $108k/yr in pensions and money in the taxable brokerage account.  My goal is to continue something close to our current lifestyle. Even though we’ll have half the income, it should be similar since we won’t have rent/mortgage or contributing to retirement accounts.

4) Find an activity to stay occupied. I’ll be at my peak earning potential and could probably get a high paying job for a few years at this point which is my insurance plan. I could also stay in the military up to 10 more years which would increase my pension to be 75% instead of the 50% multiplier. But, I really want to quit working at this point and spend time with the kids who will be in elementary/jr high school.

Age 59.5:

1) Begin retirement distributions from TSP/Roth IRA as needed

2) Attend kids’ college graduations.  Note:  We transferred our GI Bill benefits to the kids, so they can both attend a university anywhere in the county and the gov't will pay a stipend plus tuition up to the highest state university tuition in that state.  

Age 67:

1) Begin collecting social security. I figured out how to calculate this finally and it’ll be an extra $18k/yr each for us.  If we take it at 62 it’s reduced by 30%.  I should calculate what the break even age is, but assuming our health is still good we’d probably wait until age 67.

**Major risks to my plan:**

1) Wife and I getting stationed in geographically separated locations reducing our savings rate by having to maintain two households.  We ended up with another assignment together, so we only have this risk for 1-2 more moves.

2) Minimal bond exposure, I’ve been adding some over the last couple years, but primarily am invested in low cost stock index funds (vanguard and TSP).

3) Potential of a third kid. Update:  we’re really happy with our current kids, and a third kid is pretty much not going to happen, so this risk is minimal.

4) Congress making significant changes to military retirement benefits/healthcare. Update:  seems like they’ve backed off some, but this is always on the table and will most likely affect our post-retirement medical insurance more than anything else.   The current deal is ridiculously good, I can insure my family after retiring for $580/yr.   That gives you regular Tricare which is pretty much better than any commercial insurance.  When we become eligible for medicare then we have to pay the medicare part a/b premiums and Tricare for Life kicks in to cover the 20% Medicare doesn’t cover plus provides the same prescription drug coverage benefit we have now.  I think the main risk is they increase the annual premium, but even if they went from $580/yr to $580/mo I’d still be thrilled with it.


Please let me know if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to answer!

tl;dr After 2 years, net worth is now $1.4m ($444k debt, $1.85m assets) which is an increase of $461k from my last post.  Plan is to retire in 6 years at the age of 43 with $2m in assets and military pensions worth a combined $108k/yr

&lt;p&gt;Life insurance: No change in policies, $145/mo combined for both our policies.  We each have $1m which will drop in half to $500k when we retire and the work insurance goes away.  The $500k policies are 30 year term that take us to around age 63.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big expense change came from buying a house last year..  Ended up buying a $497k house with a conventional mortgage w/20% down.   We owe $384k @ 3.75%.  We plan to keep this one as a second rental property when we move in a few years to a new assignment.  I estimate owing about $300k on this when we retire.  The house is worth $510-540k or so and should rent for around $2600-2900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expenses are pretty similar, the main differences was the new mortgage payment $2431.49 and our daycare costs went way up from $1256/mo to $2200/mo.  Mostly from moving to a daycare place off base in a higher cost of living area and much more convenient to our home location.  We did away with cable tv, but everything else is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed expenses (mortgages, day care, insurance, utilities, etc): $7551/mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed savings: $7384/mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra money left in checking account each month is about $3-4k which ends up going to fixing up the house, trips, extra mortgage payments, or more often just transferring it to the brokerage account.  The new house required a bunch of work like new HVAC, windows, etc, and it still needs a new roof sometime soon.  So, that’s been a focus the house has definitely improved in value due to these repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military pensions are equal to 2.5% * yrs of service * high 3 base pay avg. So, 20 years = 50% of your base pay. Based on our expected rank at retirement, this would be $54k each. That is in today’s money and since this is tied to inflation it’d be slightly higher (6 years from now) and would continue to grow each year in retirement since it’s chained to the CPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retirement plan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age 43:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Buy a nice house somewhere with cash ($400k range) after selling the rental houses.  We really don’t know yet where this will be and how much we’d spend.  It might be worth keeping the rental houses as income or doing a 1031 transfer to get a new rental investment property.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Stop TSP/Roth IRA contributions, consider rolling over the traditional TSP into the Roth accounts as needed if we need access to this money before age 59.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Live off of $108k/yr in pensions and money in the taxable brokerage account.  My goal is to continue something close to our current lifestyle. Even though we’ll have half the income, it should be similar since we won’t have rent/mortgage or contributing to retirement accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Find an activity to stay occupied. I’ll be at my peak earning potential and could probably get a high paying job for a few years at this point which is my insurance plan. I could also stay in the military up to 10 more years which would increase my pension to be 75% instead of the 50% multiplier. But, I really want to quit working at this point and spend time with the kids who will be in elementary/jr high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age 59.5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Begin retirement distributions from TSP/Roth IRA as needed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Attend kids’ college graduations.  Note:  We transferred our GI Bill benefits to the kids, so they can both attend a university anywhere in the county and the gov&amp;#39;t will pay a stipend plus tuition up to the highest state university tuition in that state.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age 67:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Begin collecting social security. I figured out how to calculate this finally and it’ll be an extra $18k/yr each for us.  If we take it at 62 it’s reduced by 30%.  I should calculate what the break even age is, but assuming our health is still good we’d probably wait until age 67.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major risks to my plan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Wife and I getting stationed in geographically separated locations reducing our savings rate by having to maintain two households.  We ended up with another assignment together, so we only have this risk for 1-2 more moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Minimal bond exposure, I’ve been adding some over the last couple years, but primarily am invested in low cost stock index funds (vanguard and TSP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Potential of a third kid. Update:  we’re really happy with our current kids, and a third kid is pretty much not going to happen, so this risk is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Congress making significant changes to military retirement benefits/healthcare. Update:  seems like they’ve backed off some, but this is always on the table and will most likely affect our post-retirement medical insurance more than anything else.   The current deal is ridiculously good, I can insure my family after retiring for $580/yr.   That gives you regular Tricare which is pretty much better than any commercial insurance.  When we become eligible for medicare then we have to pay the medicare part a/b premiums and Tricare for Life kicks in to cover the 20% Medicare doesn’t cover plus provides the same prescription drug coverage benefit we have now.  I think the main risk is they increase the annual premium, but even if they went from $580/yr to $580/mo I’d still be thrilled with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to answer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr After 2 years, net worth is now $1.4m ($444k debt, $1.85m assets) which is an increase of $461k from my last post.  Plan is to retire in 6 years at the age of 43 with $2m in assets and military pensions worth a combined $108k/yr&lt;/p&gt;

The FIRE plan is pretty general, so I'll spare you the details. Ill be saving my usual 60&amp;#37; of each paycheck, and I'll keep enjoying inexpensive hobbies, like mountain biking, hiking, and camping. The question is, how to invest the savings for the best return? The method I decided on will seem very controvertial, so let me be clear, I know it may not work. Actually, it likely will not work the way I plan out. But the possible benefits are an extra 10 years of life without waking up to an alarm clock. 

**Background**

I am young, as in 25. I am a family medicine intern. My wife is 24, a resident optometrist. We both grew up almost poor. Like, ""always had a roof, but in a cramped house; always got a few christmas presents, but had parents that could barely get to the next paycheck, and sometimes racked up credit card debt to do so"" kind of poor. We also graduated from high school into the teeth of the Great Recession. Between that and our combined 15 years of college/professional school, we are experts at surviving off nothing and delaying purchases until we absolutely need them. We do not want kids, so we do not have to be as financially secure as a normal family. We are doing well now, with combined incomes of $5000 and $2000 per month for myself and my wife, respectively. This is more money flowing in than we have ever had. And we are so frugal, we usually only spend 30-40&amp;#37; of each paycheck. 

\*Plus, I was a vandweller for a while, so I know have a Plan C as well\*

So, since we are so young, and yet toughened, we can take risks now and still have a decent length working life to make up for the likely failure of those risks. However, should the risk pay off, we could possibly FatFIRE within 1-2 years. I'd say the chance of that success is... maybe 1 in 3. It was good enough for Sean Connery and the Red October. And to have some time in our 20s back from the hellhole that is professional education... oh my god so worth the risk.

So, in the hopes that people will recognize we did not make this decision lightly, and we are simply trying to go out of the box, even the normal FIRE box, to attain freedom. Here is our story, and here is our plan.

**Learning how to invest**

Back in 2016, I had read some of the MMM blogs, and a few thousand dollars saved up. I was looking for anything that had decent returns, and a friend showed me how the Dow had tanked on news about China, and how he wished he had cash when the price was lower. At the time, I questioned the wisdom of buying when the market was going down. He looked at me, smiled, and told me it was just on sale. 

So I got a Wealthfront account and put a few hundred in at 90&amp;#37; stocks. The market recovered within months and I had a pretty good return. I then took some funds out. I tried timing things using the ""Fear/Greed Index"" and Warren Buffets ""be greedy when others are fearful"" advice. I wasn't a day trader, more of a week trader. Then the stock market went down a little, and I bought more. I was just super lucky, but I thought I had a good stomach for risk at that point.

**Finding... (Dare I say it...) cryptocurrencies**

Here I may lose some of you, if you hate the idea of cryptocurrencys, and I respect your opinion. They are almost all speculation at this point, so I don't blame you. 

Anyway, I went looking for other, more volatile markets to apply Buffets advice after stocks flattened out in 2016. My sister's boyfriend told me he played with cryptocurrencies. So, I took some money off Wealthfront and I dabbled a bit on Gemini with Bitcoin ($600 at the time) and Ethereum ($12 at the time). I did my best to sell high, and buy in when FUD went around. I had put in maybe 1/2 of all my savings at that point. In total, my savings was only $15k then, but that was literally my life savings. Most was in Ethereum since it was cheaper. I started researching Bitcoin and Ethereum, and I liked Eth better.

Naturally, Ethereum took a 30&amp;#37; dump to $9, and I realized that ""volatile"" meant down as well as up. Feeling a little stung, I pulled most of my remaining funds from Ethereum to even out my stock gains to avoid capital gains tax headaches (since I had no idea how any of that worked back then either.) 

Equally naturally, Ethereum then went off the rails to $40 before I could get my cash back in. The FOMO was strong, and I'm still kicking myself for missing that huge first leap. Luckily, it went from $40 to $400 in the span of a year. I had gone from $15k to $150k. I was in vapor lock for most of 2017 over this. I had never built up so much, so fast, and especially as it went higher in Autumn. At that point, I decided to pull from Ethereum and diversify in the cryptos, thinking the other shoe must be about to drop. 

**XRP and the New Years 2018 Ripple Pump**

My sister's boyfriend again gave me some advice. He casually mentioned Ripple might be picked up by some big companies. My first thought was, ""What the heck is a Ripple?"" So I did some digging, and managed to get on the Kraken exchange, and glitched my way to a few hundred thousand XRP, while saving some of my precious Ethereum. Then XRP had that massive speculative pump, and I suddenly had over a 7-figure net worth within weeks. I was giddy. Then the market slumped. No big deal, I told myself. Then XRP took an 80&amp;#37; dump. \*80. FREAKING. PERCENT.\* 

I lost over $800,000 on paper from the high. I consoled myself on still having a mid 6-figure net worth, even to this day, but that didn't help much. As to why I did not withdraw at the peak, it was because I was simply astonished, a bit greedy, and I had no idea how such massive capital gains would impact my taxes, since they would be short term gains. At the time, I remember deciding not to decide and just roll with it. I knew I was young enough to deal with the volatility. So Im still holding on, even as the cryptocurrency market stumbles along.

**The Gamble**

Thank you for reading along this far. Before going any further, allow me to clarify that I don't want to sound like a gambler who can make his losses back with ""just one more good hand..."" which this will certainly sound like. My calculated risk is this: We will pour every extra cent that we can into XRP until we are 30 or have $6-8 million, whichever comes first. We would never do any leverage trades, as buying on margin is as stupid as essentially burning money in such volatile markets. If XRP has not taken off by the time we are 30, we will re-evaluate it against other cryptos with use-cases or stocks. Meanwhile, we will remain as frugal as we have always been, and continue to save at least 60&amp;#37; of each paycheck. The idea is this: plenty of people discover the FIRE movement in their 30s, after having terrible financial habits and no savings. If those people can FIRE in a few years, we would be able to do so as well if the Crypto market collapses. Its been around since 2009, so I bet it will be around at least another decade. 

**The reasoning**

There is a finance quote that goes something like, ""diversification protects, concentration grows,"" and right now we need our funds to grow, quickly, to reach FIRE. I have researched Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and XRP. I chose XRP because it serves a very useful purpose already. Ethereum does as well, but currently mostly in theory. I agree with MMM on Bitcoin, in that it is a ""greater fool"" game. Bitcoin is also the first. So was MySpace. 

Anyway, XRP could easily become highly prized by banks for global money transfers, and in providing an actual service, behaves more as a ""natural resource"" than a security. And it is wise to buy natural resources before the demand grows for it. Imagine buying land in West Texas before the automobile was invented. 

Also, while I hate to depend on speculation, rampant speculation made me a momentary-millionaire on paper over the course of weeks earlier this year. Even if having a good use-case isn't enough, I bet the speculators will return to the cryptosphere within the next year because it could be very useful. Call that my ""Hail-Mary.""

**Discussion on Ripple and XRP, and why most people hate it. Skip if you don't want the technical talk**

So there are currently a lot of risks. XRP could be ruled a security of the Ripple Company, and it would not be listed on certain exchanges. XRP could be abandoned by Ripple. XRP could grow more slowly than Ethereum, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, or the myriad of other cryptocurrencies like EOS, Litecoin, or Cardano. Additionally, XRP uses a Ledger protocol, which is different from the Proof of Work ""mining"" required for Bitcoin or Ethereum. So it may technically not actually be a real cryptocurrency in the traditional sense. This makes it understandable why so many people do not like it, since they don't understand it compared to what they're used to. That doesn't mean it can't have value. 

I have an answer to those concerns listed above. Ripple is doing its best to conform to SEC rules, and wants to be regulated as a currency. XRP likely won't be ruled a security, even though Ripple is selling the technology to utilize them. Currently XRP and its ledger system operate independently from Ripple, and can scale to demand, using tiny fees taken from each transaction. As far as growth, XRP does tend to lag, however, last time Bitcoin was $6k, XRP was $0.20. Now Bitcoin is $6k, and XRP is $0.45. I'll take 100&amp;#37; growth any day. And with some nudging from the Ripple Company, I think XRP is most likely to increase in value, and stay increased, where something else more popular may get pumped faster, then quickly dumped. That happened to XRP already, so I like to think it ""got it out of it's system.""

To digress a moment on the security/currency/natural resource thing, imagine XRP as a lump of iron. Now imagine you're in the bronze age. Ripple found and mined the iron, and had a lot of it. It was found to be valuable, so Ripple had to carefully manage how it interacts with the Iron supply. Now the lumps are being released by an escrow, so Ripple doesn't control such a large suppy any more. (Ripple is also decentralizing their control of the XRP ledger, with more 3rd party nodes coming online.) So, these lumps of iron are sitting there, and Ripple had an idea. Rather than use horses to carry sacks of gold, they could build a rail system out of the iron. Ripple would control the rail system. The iron could be made into mine carts. So, Ripple doesn't control the carts, just the rails, and so doesn't have to have the carts regulated as portions of the company. Kingdoms can easily transfer their gold to other kingdoms on the rails in the carts that they own. Buy the iron, and you can move value with it. That inherently gives value to the iron, since there is a finite supply. The cool thing is though, what else can iron be used for besides carts? I don't know, but someone like Jeff Bezos might. 

**Historical Comparison**

Jeff Bezos came up with a book sales program. He focused it, got really good at it, and customers loved it. It became super popular, then it branched out and is involved in nearly everything. Anyone who invested in early Amazon is extremely wealthy. 

Ripple the Company is getting really good at one thing, global payments. And they may be decentralizing, but Ripple can still nudge XRPs future. In the future, Ripple will certainly find other uses for their programs and for the global XRP supply. For example, imagine if it became the standard Xbox Live or PS4 Online token. Good golly miss molly, everyone and their grandmother would be trying to buy them.

So, with so many unknowns, XRP is unpopular now, and thus cheap. But IF it is ruled not a security, and IF it is used in global remittance markets, and IF the Ripple developers don't get stolen away by other blockchain teams, and IF another coin doesn't come out and do XRPs job better... then this might be a very dirty, balled up, golden ticket. We shall see. If you have questions, please comment, and I will try to better explain what I have found in my research. 

**Recap**

So, being young and able to stomach some epic risks, (really, does the stock market count as risky if everyone intends to be able to have a 4&amp;#37; SWR after inflation?) I am going to put all my eggs in one basket. My life savings in XRP. At least til Im 30. If the gamble fails, I work 8 years as a frugal physician and FIRE before Im 40. If XRP (and a few Eth for good luck) go crazy, I may FIRE before 30. That extra 10 years is, like Tom Hanks says in  Joe vs The Volcano, ""gold in my hand."" 

Since there are a lot of ways to get to FIRE, please let me know if anyone else is trying the ""eggs in one basket, concentrate wealth to grow"" strategy. Or if you took a similarly huge risk that worked out, what is your story?

\*\*\*I would love to answer any questions, but please also do your own research, and only invest what you can afford to lose. We have income, so we can afford to lose a good chunk of our life savings. We watched our parents survive that in 2009.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey ladies and gents, they say goals are best acomplished if you tell others, so here is my story, and my plan.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding... (Dare I say it...) cryptocurrencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I may lose some of you, if you hate the idea of cryptocurrencys, and I respect your opinion. They are almost all speculation at this point, so I don&amp;#39;t blame you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went looking for other, more volatile markets to apply Buffets advice after stocks flattened out in 2016. My sister&amp;#39;s boyfriend told me he played with cryptocurrencies. So, I took some money off Wealthfront and I dabbled a bit on Gemini with Bitcoin ($600 at the time) and Ethereum ($12 at the time). I did my best to sell high, and buy in when FUD went around. I had put in maybe 1/2 of all my savings at that point. In total, my savings was only $15k then, but that was literally my life savings. Most was in Ethereum since it was cheaper. I started researching Bitcoin and Ethereum, and I liked Eth better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, Ethereum took a 30&amp;#37; dump to $9, and I realized that &amp;quot;volatile&amp;quot; meant down as well as up. Feeling a little stung, I pulled most of my remaining funds from Ethereum to even out my stock gains to avoid capital gains tax headaches (since I had no idea how any of that worked back then either.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally naturally, Ethereum then went off the rails to $40 before I could get my cash back in. The FOMO was strong, and I&amp;#39;m still kicking myself for missing that huge first leap. Luckily, it went from $40 to $400 in the span of a year. I had gone from $15k to $150k. I was in vapor lock for most of 2017 over this. I had never built up so much, so fast, and especially as it went higher in Autumn. At that point, I decided to pull from Ethereum and diversify in the cryptos, thinking the other shoe must be about to drop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XRP and the New Years 2018 Ripple Pump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister&amp;#39;s boyfriend again gave me some advice. He casually mentioned Ripple might be picked up by some big companies. My first thought was, &amp;quot;What the heck is a Ripple?&amp;quot; So I did some digging, and managed to get on the Kraken exchange, and glitched my way to a few hundred thousand XRP, while saving some of my precious Ethereum. Then XRP had that massive speculative pump, and I suddenly had over a 7-figure net worth within weeks. I was giddy. Then the market slumped. No big deal, I told myself. Then XRP took an 80&amp;#37; dump. *80. FREAKING. PERCENT.* &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost over $800,000 on paper from the high. I consoled myself on still having a mid 6-figure net worth, even to this day, but that didn&amp;#39;t help much. As to why I did not withdraw at the peak, it was because I was simply astonished, a bit greedy, and I had no idea how such massive capital gains would impact my taxes, since they would be short term gains. At the time, I remember deciding not to decide and just roll with it. I knew I was young enough to deal with the volatility. So Im still holding on, even as the cryptocurrency market stumbles along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gamble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading along this far. Before going any further, allow me to clarify that I don&amp;#39;t want to sound like a gambler who can make his losses back with &amp;quot;just one more good hand...&amp;quot; which this will certainly sound like. My calculated risk is this: We will pour every extra cent that we can into XRP until we are 30 or have $6-8 million, whichever comes first. We would never do any leverage trades, as buying on margin is as stupid as essentially burning money in such volatile markets. If XRP has not taken off by the time we are 30, we will re-evaluate it against other cryptos with use-cases or stocks. Meanwhile, we will remain as frugal as we have always been, and continue to save at least 60&amp;#37; of each paycheck. The idea is this: plenty of people discover the FIRE movement in their 30s, after having terrible financial habits and no savings. If those people can FIRE in a few years, we would be able to do so as well if the Crypto market collapses. Its been around since 2009, so I bet it will be around at least another decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a finance quote that goes something like, &amp;quot;diversification protects, concentration grows,&amp;quot; and right now we need our funds to grow, quickly, to reach FIRE. I have researched Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and XRP. I chose XRP because it serves a very useful purpose already. Ethereum does as well, but currently mostly in theory. I agree with MMM on Bitcoin, in that it is a &amp;quot;greater fool&amp;quot; game. Bitcoin is also the first. So was MySpace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, XRP could easily become highly prized by banks for global money transfers, and in providing an actual service, behaves more as a &amp;quot;natural resource&amp;quot; than a security. And it is wise to buy natural resources before the demand grows for it. Imagine buying land in West Texas before the automobile was invented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, while I hate to depend on speculation, rampant speculation made me a momentary-millionaire on paper over the course of weeks earlier this year. Even if having a good use-case isn&amp;#39;t enough, I bet the speculators will return to the cryptosphere within the next year because it could be very useful. Call that my &amp;quot;Hail-Mary.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion on Ripple and XRP, and why most people hate it. Skip if you don&amp;#39;t want the technical talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are currently a lot of risks. XRP could be ruled a security of the Ripple Company, and it would not be listed on certain exchanges. XRP could be abandoned by Ripple. XRP could grow more slowly than Ethereum, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, or the myriad of other cryptocurrencies like EOS, Litecoin, or Cardano. Additionally, XRP uses a Ledger protocol, which is different from the Proof of Work &amp;quot;mining&amp;quot; required for Bitcoin or Ethereum. So it may technically not actually be a real cryptocurrency in the traditional sense. This makes it understandable why so many people do not like it, since they don&amp;#39;t understand it compared to what they&amp;#39;re used to. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean it can&amp;#39;t have value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an answer to those concerns listed above. Ripple is doing its best to conform to SEC rules, and wants to be regulated as a currency. XRP likely won&amp;#39;t be ruled a security, even though Ripple is selling the technology to utilize them. Currently XRP and its ledger system operate independently from Ripple, and can scale to demand, using tiny fees taken from each transaction. As far as growth, XRP does tend to lag, however, last time Bitcoin was $6k, XRP was $0.20. Now Bitcoin is $6k, and XRP is $0.45. I&amp;#39;ll take 100&amp;#37; growth any day. And with some nudging from the Ripple Company, I think XRP is most likely to increase in value, and stay increased, where something else more popular may get pumped faster, then quickly dumped. That happened to XRP already, so I like to think it &amp;quot;got it out of it&amp;#39;s system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To digress a moment on the security/currency/natural resource thing, imagine XRP as a lump of iron. Now imagine you&amp;#39;re in the bronze age. Ripple found and mined the iron, and had a lot of it. It was found to be valuable, so Ripple had to carefully manage how it interacts with the Iron supply. Now the lumps are being released by an escrow, so Ripple doesn&amp;#39;t control such a large suppy any more. (Ripple is also decentralizing their control of the XRP ledger, with more 3rd party nodes coming online.) So, these lumps of iron are sitting there, and Ripple had an idea. Rather than use horses to carry sacks of gold, they could build a rail system out of the iron. Ripple would control the rail system. The iron could be made into mine carts. So, Ripple doesn&amp;#39;t control the carts, just the rails, and so doesn&amp;#39;t have to have the carts regulated as portions of the company. Kingdoms can easily transfer their gold to other kingdoms on the rails in the carts that they own. Buy the iron, and you can move value with it. That inherently gives value to the iron, since there is a finite supply. The cool thing is though, what else can iron be used for besides carts? I don&amp;#39;t know, but someone like Jeff Bezos might. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos came up with a book sales program. He focused it, got really good at it, and customers loved it. It became super popular, then it branched out and is involved in nearly everything. Anyone who invested in early Amazon is extremely wealthy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripple the Company is getting really good at one thing, global payments. And they may be decentralizing, but Ripple can still nudge XRPs future. In the future, Ripple will certainly find other uses for their programs and for the global XRP supply. For example, imagine if it became the standard Xbox Live or PS4 Online token. Good golly miss molly, everyone and their grandmother would be trying to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with so many unknowns, XRP is unpopular now, and thus cheap. But IF it is ruled not a security, and IF it is used in global remittance markets, and IF the Ripple developers don&amp;#39;t get stolen away by other blockchain teams, and IF another coin doesn&amp;#39;t come out and do XRPs job better... then this might be a very dirty, balled up, golden ticket. We shall see. If you have questions, please comment, and I will try to better explain what I have found in my research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, being young and able to stomach some epic risks, (really, does the stock market count as risky if everyone intends to be able to have a 4&amp;#37; SWR after inflation?) I am going to put all my eggs in one basket. My life savings in XRP. At least til Im 30. If the gamble fails, I work 8 years as a frugal physician and FIRE before Im 40. If XRP (and a few Eth for good luck) go crazy, I may FIRE before 30. That extra 10 years is, like Tom Hanks says in  Joe vs The Volcano, &amp;quot;gold in my hand.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are a lot of ways to get to FIRE, please let me know if anyone else is trying the &amp;quot;eggs in one basket, concentrate wealth to grow&amp;quot; strategy. Or if you took a similarly huge risk that worked out, what is your story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***I would love to answer any questions, but please also do your own research, and only invest what you can afford to lose. We have income, so we can afford to lose a good chunk of our life savings. We watched our parents survive that in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

My question is whether this **at all contenplates the risk of starting up a business and relative failure rate of small businesses**, particularly with ones own capital.  Frankly, one could argue that an entrepreneur's reputational capital is at risk even if outside capital is raised to start a business that fails.

IE they aren't very good at many elements of it, but because they started ""on third base"", and can use leverage to their advantage, keep building more wealth.

In my field, i see dozens of people, some of which have generational wealth, who frankly succeed in this field in spite of themselves.  IE they aren&amp;#39;t very good at many elements of it, but because they started &amp;quot;on third base&amp;quot;, and can use leverage to their advantage, keep building more wealth.  I feel as though I could own/develop real estate, though part of me (maybe laziness) just doesn&amp;#39;t want the hassle or capital at risk.

# Superannuation in Australia  

Superannuation (super) is the retirement savings account for Australians. Contributions to a person’s super are *required by law* and have tax advantages going into super and when withdrawn in retirement.  

##### Getting money into Super  

The primary contributions to your super account come from your employer. If you work more than 30 hours per week an employer is required to contribute at least 9.5% of your wage to a super account. An employer may contribute more, such as some government work or academic institutions will contribute 17% or more, but not less than 9.5%. You do not have to make any sacrifice to get a 'match' like a 401K this is in addition to, not subtracted from your salary/wages.  

&gt; A salary of $100,000 would have an additional $9,500 contributed to your nominated super account. Both figures before tax.  

You can also make additional ‘voluntary’ contributions up to various limits. Currently $25,000 per year can contributed to your super before tax, so called ‘concessional’ contributions. The employer contribution of ~9.5-17% count to this limit. These amounts will not count to your income tax for the year and are often made though ‘salary sacrificing’ but can also be paid directly to your super fund and declared on your tax return later. You can also carry forward unused concessional contributions for 5 years if you have less than $500,000 in your super.  

Concessional contributions are not however completely tax free, they are taxed at a flat 15%, or 30% if you earn more than $250,000/year. This is however much better than the income tax rates and where much of the benefit of super comes in. For low income earners (&lt;$37,000) the government will refund the first $500 of this tax, so that you’re not losing money. 

You can also make after tax contributions up to $100,000 per year. As you would have already paid income tax on these there is no further tax. After $100,000 in after tax contributions if you still contribute you will be liable for a 47% tax on the *earnings* from that amount over that $100,000 cap, which is equal to the highest income tax bracket. There are some exemptions to this such as personal injury settlements, or bringing forward 2 future years worth of cap. For low income earners, the government will also match post tax contributions at a rate of ~50% up to $500 each year.  

&gt; I can contribute $300,000 post tax this year and not pay tax on the earnings but I can’t make any more post tax contributions in the next two years.  

So consider my $100,000 salary from before, I decide to contribute an extra $10,000 before tax.  
 
&gt; I now have a taxable income of $90,000 and $19,500 is contributed to my super account. After tax values would therefore be around $68,000 in take home pay and $16,575 to my super. About $3,000 less paid in tax overall than if I made no extra contributions.  

The tax benefits on super also continue for the investment returns. As we hope that compounding is doing its work your investments will also be growing. Investment returns inside a super fund are also taxed at a flat 15% for short term gains, and 10% for long term capital gains.  

#####Where the money is invested  

While your super is growing, it will be held in a super funds. These can be:  
Industry funds, focused on a specific sector e.g. retail workers,  
Retail funds, standard investment/financial institutions,  
Public sector funds, for government employees,  
Corporate funds, run by your employer,  
Self-managed super funds (SMSF), managed by yourself, probably best to get a good accountant. A general rule of thumb is that SMSF will only become worth the investment once you have a balance &gt;$200,000-300,000.  

A super fund is usually like any mutual fund, the money is invested, fees subtracted and distributions/growth received. Depending on the type of fund you will have less control (public sector funds) or total control (SMSF) over how your money is invested. Many super funds also have bundled life/death/disability insurance which can syphon off a lot of money without people noticing.  

#####Getting money out of Super   

So we have built up a nice retirement account what now? In general, to access your super you have to be old, or retiring, or both. Once you reach the age of 60 and retire, or 65, you can receive your money as an income stream or a lump sum, usually completely tax free.  There is a limit of $1.6 million (indexed for inflation) that can be transferred from the accumulation phase to the tax free retirement phase. Amounts above this will be subject to a 15-30% tax on their earnings  from the date of transferring and can be converted to a taxable account that pays income/capital gains tax as normal. Being over this $1.6 million can also affects the caps of how much you can contribute before and after tax e.g. carrying forward pre tax contributions.  

There are very few ways to receive money earlier. You can apply under compassionate grounds or due to financial hardship such as paying for medical treatment to receive funds early. These are usually taxed between 17-22%. Although a new scheme is the ability to withdraw voluntary pre or post tax contributions (up to ~$30,000) for the purchase of/deposit on your first house. This will be taxed at your marginal income tax rate less 30%.  

### Summary  

So overall superannuation is a pretty good system for those looking to FIRE. It allows most Australians to cruise along knowing that they are saving ~10% of their income automatically in tax advantaged accounts. Additional contributions can help get your tax rate a bit lower and tax free gains up to a $1.6 million portfolio. These tax benefits come at the cost of locking the money away until a normal retirement age of 60+.  

There is also an aged pension in Australia for those over 67, with a maximum rate of $900/fortnight. This value decreases as your income increases, per individual in a couple, etc. but can help supplement your super if you do not have enough or live long enough to exhaust your retirement savings.

&lt;p&gt;While your super is growing, it will be held in a super funds. These can be:&lt;br/&gt;
Industry funds, focused on a specific sector e.g. retail workers,&lt;br/&gt;
Retail funds, standard investment/financial institutions,&lt;br/&gt;
Public sector funds, for government employees,&lt;br/&gt;
Corporate funds, run by your employer,&lt;br/&gt;
Self-managed super funds (SMSF), managed by yourself, probably best to get a good accountant. A general rule of thumb is that SMSF will only become worth the investment once you have a balance &amp;gt;$200,000-300,000.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A super fund is usually like any mutual fund, the money is invested, fees subtracted and distributions/growth received. Depending on the type of fund you will have less control (public sector funds) or total control (SMSF) over how your money is invested. Many super funds also have bundled life/death/disability insurance which can syphon off a lot of money without people noticing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Getting money out of Super&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have built up a nice retirement account what now? In general, to access your super you have to be old, or retiring, or both. Once you reach the age of 60 and retire, or 65, you can receive your money as an income stream or a lump sum, usually completely tax free.  There is a limit of $1.6 million (indexed for inflation) that can be transferred from the accumulation phase to the tax free retirement phase. Amounts above this will be subject to a 15-30% tax on their earnings  from the date of transferring and can be converted to a taxable account that pays income/capital gains tax as normal. Being over this $1.6 million can also affects the caps of how much you can contribute before and after tax e.g. carrying forward pre tax contributions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few ways to receive money earlier. You can apply under compassionate grounds or due to financial hardship such as paying for medical treatment to receive funds early. These are usually taxed between 17-22%. Although a new scheme is the ability to withdraw voluntary pre or post tax contributions (up to ~$30,000) for the purchase of/deposit on your first house. This will be taxed at your marginal income tax rate less 30%.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall superannuation is a pretty good system for those looking to FIRE. It allows most Australians to cruise along knowing that they are saving ~10% of their income automatically in tax advantaged accounts. Additional contributions can help get your tax rate a bit lower and tax free gains up to a $1.6 million portfolio. These tax benefits come at the cost of locking the money away until a normal retirement age of 60+.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also an aged pension in Australia for those over 67, with a maximum rate of $900/fortnight. This value decreases as your income increases, per individual in a couple, etc. but can help supplement your super if you do not have enough or live long enough to exhaust your retirement savings.   &lt;/p&gt;

People here have a ""FIRE Number"" and a ""annual spending number"" and even withdrawal numbers like they are set in stone.

Yet  during your accumulation phases, you are flexible...you cut spending to entertainment, cut spending on that new car, cut spending on a bigger  house with a bigger mortgage and yet during retirement, you won't  compromise on anything?

I've heard  comments like, ""4&amp;#37; withdrawal rate"" only has a 80&amp;#37; chance of success and 20&amp;#37;  chance of failure or whatever. Who gives a flying hoot what the success rate is? I mean, why not just tighten your belt when a recession hits?

I  feel like people think there's 2 states, one is working and one is retired and once you go to the retired state, you should never hop back  to the working state.

I'll be honest: I have 0 idea what my retirement spending is going to be.

However, If I FIRE'd but feel like my spending is not enough, I go back to work.

I’ve evidently been doing FIRE the last 15 years without knowing there was a name for it.  

My father is a mathatician and showed me how compound interest works when I got my first real job out of college. Told me to save at least 10% and I’d reach a million. His advice lead me to read the Automatic Millionaire when I first started out.  Really the only book I read other than Warren Buffet’s works.  I also stay up to speed with things going on.  This has been my goal.   I started off saving 10% for retirement, first raise I got I increased to 15%, at one point – right before kids- I was saving 20%..(not counting 5% match from my employer).   I was kind of obsessed with the “latte factor” from that book, and started thinking about EVERY penny I was spending… You can really go crazy with that, so be carefull.  So I decided to make things simple and just save 20%. That way, I wouldn’t have to over-think every small purchase - and just relax. 20% is tough. 
 
I’ve been working as a government employee now for 15 years, I’m 40 years old, I’m estimating I’ll reach my first million in about 6 years.  I’ll post my specific investments in my next post. But each month, for the past 15 years of my working life, I’ve updated my own financinal spreadsheet with all the balances in all my accounts.  If the balance went up, I colored it black, red if went down.  I also graphed my retirement balance each month. It’s interesting to see the ups and downs over the years, and how the overall trend is always up.  I also plotted out a “family of curves” on a huge piece of paper of different senarios:  a person making $100k per year and saving 10%, $35,000 per year saving 15%,  Each year I plot my balance on the paper to where it falls in the family of curves.  I’m on track for the million shortly.  It’s cool to visually see how the next millions come a lot quicker than the first. 

I’m an engineer by trade, don’t claim to be an economist or money expert, but I’ve come to realize that you don’t have to be. In fact, the less you pay attention to financial news.. the better!  I’m serious.  Don’t pay attention to the ups and downs of the market, just keep investing, you buy more shares when the market is down… Just pay attention to your allocation over time to adjust your risk tolerance.  

I’ve keep everything simple: work hard, save hard for retirment, minimize expenses, track monthly cash flow, don’t spend more then you earn, save for vacation, enjoy life and make memories with wife and kids.    Yet, it never ceases to amaze me when I hear co workers talking about money.  It really puzzles me, I’ve found that most people, some really smart people too, don’t have a basic understanding of the time value of money and how compound interest is an exponential function.  It’s a curve!. Or, in fact, that it even exists!  I’m lucky for my father who first introduced me to the concept.  I also had one class in engineering school that talked about economics and the time value of money. 

Here’s some Mainstream Advice -often spoutted out from co workers- that are completely wrong – but I keep hearing over and over again and also some basic understanding people lack:

-	Can’t get rich working as a Government Employee. Bullshit. 
-	Can’t make real money in the Thrifts Savings Program (TSP) because the funds suck. Bullshit again. 
-	Can’t get rich working for someone else.. (love this one) Complete bullshit. 
-	Seems as though people don’t undertand what dollar cost averaging means. I opened an Index fund 10 years ago, invested only $35 per month, and it has grown to a sustantial amount now. But yet, if I’d did nothing, that $35 would have been adsorbed into my checking account and dissapered forever.  Wouldn’t have even “felt” it.  
-	Seems as though people don’t understand that stocks go and up and down, but the overall trend has been up. 
-	Seems as though people don’t understand that you can make 10% (or more, whatever the number really is) in the market over your working career. 
-	Seems as though people don’t understand that you can reach a million in about 20 years of heavy saving, but the 2nd million, 3rd million, and 4th million time interval gets shorter and shorter because of the expodential curve.  Do the math, depending on when you begin working/saving, you can start doubling your balance every year at one point.  It is the most powerful force in the universe. 
-	I know very smart accountants at work who talk about this sector and that sector, and you can tell they listen to wall street news everyday, but don’t know about compound interest nor do they practice it.  One time I mentioned it and I was laughed out of the room. Fuck them. I learned to never discuss money after that. I’ll be the one laughing at the end. 
-	People don’t know that daily stock updates don’t mean shit.   It’s always gone up so- ignore it.
-	I still hear people talking about timing the market and I just laugh. Really, it’s 2018? Don’t they know the facts about this? One time I asked my friend how he manages to be right twice by doing that? He just looked at me.  Smart guy with MBA, finance major, but just doesn’t know.  Dude has about $5k in retirement for the last 10 years but yet stills tries to time the market.  He talks a really great game, sounds like he is already a millionaire, but has no money. 

My net worth just hit $1 million by not understanding a DAMN thing about the stock market – other than that it always goes up over the long term- by utilizing dollar cost averaging and constantly increasing my contribution % (and adjusting allocation of course depending on risk profile).  Some people study the roots while others just pick the fruits.  I just pick the fruits. I don’t really care how it all works..but it does work.  

I have a theory about all this. Over the years, after talking with co wokers, there’s a huge gap in this basic understanding – I’m not sure how/why some of these smart people don’t save for retirement.  I’m starting to belive this is BY DESIGN… by society.  Perhaps I’m a conspiracy theorist, but I really think this to be the case.  Why is this not taught in school? Why doesn’t the school teach how easy it all is? 

We are bombarded with doom &amp; gloom news everyday- Everything from crime to the stock market.  I see people consume all this negative information and discuss over the water cooler at work.  It’s the same shit that keeps getting repeated everyday.  Do they not know that negative information sells? – it’s a scare tactic. I’m not saying to ignore what’s going on in the world, but just to be aware of the tactics the mainstream media uses.  I really believe that society tries to dumb us all down.  They try to make everything, especially Financial advice sound so complicated- on purpose.  That we give up.  When we’re depressed, we’re more willing to go to that 9–5 job that we hate and only accept a 2 week vacation…. Perhaps?  

Most of mainstream advice is so watered down because it has to be understood by the least common denominator. Anything scalable in large quantities to sell to the masses out there, is crap. A McDonalds hamburger is complete crap, but yet sells millions.   Negative energy lowers our consciences and frequency, closes our hearts, makes us afraid, and sucks our life energy away.  Perhaps, it’s a controlling technique they try to do to us.  I know this all sounds crazy, but I really believe it at this point.  I can see the matrix.  If you try to talk to people about savings and compound interest, it’s almost like they are pre-programmed and brainwashed to chew you out and lash out at anything you say! It’s crazy. I never offer advice unless specifically asked. 

Anyway, just wanted to share with you guys my personal experience from the Government sector and all the misunderstanding there is out there.. and if you feel the same as I do?  

I’m learning a lot here. 

Thanks.

I've been reading the threads for the last few weeks and appreciate the discussions. I'm not new to the concept of FIRE. Before knowing about FIRE, by chance, I learned about compound interest and began maxing out retirement accounts, savings rate and investments since my first job. Fast forward a bit, I'm now mid 30's, live in the bay area, and found myself sacked (politics), and decided that I would travel through the remaining parts of Asia for the greater part of a year to learn more about the world and maybe the future. I've always liked work and advanced quickly, but the experience did leave a sour taste in my mouth. I have some concerns about reentering the workforce in the future, but since I like working and I have a network, I see plenty of options...

I came back from my trip and realized that I am already on the lower end of the FI spectrum, and with my lifestyle and other considerations (i.e. house) am probably in the RE range, so I'm taking a risk to start a for profit non profit, which will likely take years to get up and running, with considerable risk of failure. I'm starting to find myself quite busy by the duties of building an organization by myself (for now), reading books, maintaining the house, spending time with my girlfriend, staying informed, writing a blog (mainly to help cement my travel memories), getting enough sleep, etc.

I didn't think I would be so busy. Wasn't RE suppose to free up time to do all the things I wanted? I'm surprised at the volume of things that I want to do and don't seem to have enough time for. How do you all prioritize and manage your time? 

Another trend I've noticed is that as I learn more, I learn about even more things that I want to learn about. I sense more and more things coming up than less. Ironically, for me, FIRE may be more stressful than being an office worker. The thought of going back to work so I can limit my options even crossed my mind. Do some of you also experience these conflicts/choices?

I grew up in poverty and it's taken a lot to change and shift my mindset to where I am now, so I realize the privilege and luck that allowed me to even be in this space asking these questions. I want to make the most of my time to do the most good I can in the world while allowing myself time to do the things that FIRE enables. Not to say that they are conflicting goals, but they do require a framework to evaluate time decisions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone.

So yesterday, I asked this sub [how you felt about your job](https://redd.it/8xaiig). How much happiness do you sacrifice by working, and do you feel like your current salary justifies that?

I'll be honest, I didn't expect to get &gt;100 responses but I have really enjoyed reading each and every one of them.

Some of you [have it pretty good](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e2203i5/), while others [suffer quite a bit because of their job](
https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e22tow6) (this one made me laugh, actually. I'm super sorry!)

All these responses inspired me to just go ahead and put it in a spreadsheet, which I now want to share with you again. I guess this is my way of giving back, as reading your answers really was fun and inspiring. If you commented on this post, then your answer should be somewhere in that spreadsheet.

I think the graph itself is not that interesting, and there is probably a lot wrong with it (from a data perspective). All the data points are basically my own interpretation of your replies, some of which were detailed but more often than not less-detailed ;-) [Comments like these were pretty easy to chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e22nju4/). You can see everything I did in the spreadsheet I linked to. I hope you don't hate me for it.

Also, I've changed the axes around, as mentioned by someone else. Your happiness sacrifice influences salary, not the other way around.

I like how most of you simply tolerate your jobs (about half of the replies). You don't love it, but the money is good and it provides a means to an end. 

This analysis also makes me appreciate my job more. Hell, I may still be in the honeymoon phase.

By the way, please don't take this too serious. I just wanted to see how the r/fire crowd feels about their jobs, and had a little fun with your reactions. I might have gone a little too far, I don't know lol.

Let me know if you have any questions! :)

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday, I asked this sub &lt;a href=""https://redd.it/8xaiig""&gt;how you felt about your job&lt;/a&gt;. How much happiness do you sacrifice by working, and do you feel like your current salary justifies that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be honest, I didn&amp;#39;t expect to get &amp;gt;100 responses but I have really enjoyed reading each and every one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e2203i5/""&gt;have it pretty good&lt;/a&gt;, while others &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e22tow6""&gt;suffer quite a bit because of their job&lt;/a&gt; (this one made me laugh, actually. I&amp;#39;m super sorry!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these responses inspired me to just go ahead and put it in a spreadsheet, which I now want to share with you again. I guess this is my way of giving back, as reading your answers really was fun and inspiring. If you commented on this post, then your answer should be somewhere in that spreadsheet. If not, then I&amp;#39;m sorry, I must have missed it. :(&lt;/p&gt;

I assumed their medical insurance would cover their injuries and their disability insurance would cover their lost wages.

About a month and a half later, I was served with a lawsuit from that person for medical costs and lost wages due to my ""negligence."" The insurance company provided the attorney, handled the whole lawsuit, and settled with the plaintiff. Easily the best peace of mind that $250 could have bought.

Sorry for the depressing topic but i'm having a bit of a rough patch and needed some advice. Bit of background 27, married, 1 child single income earner. NW around 200k (401k, Roth IRA, Crypto, Vanguards, Investment house and personal residence) 100&amp;#37; in my name, no joint account as my wife is a SAHM and made &amp; spent her whole salary before we had kids (10k/year)

My wife and I are really having a hard time seeing eye to eye and I fear that divorce is going to be inevitable. For the sake of our child we are trying everything to make it work but some people are just too different to work. I'm not looking for relationship advice so please save the ""counseling"" type advice, I'm trying everything I can but pessimistic about the future. I was young, dumb and in love and regret not getting a prenup.

I'm asking if anyone has any advice on how to minimize losses during a divorce. Is there anything or anywhere that my money would be safe. I'm wondering if crypto would be a good place to hold my liquid cash? Also my investment property was purchased by me prior to marriage so I've heard that in the event of divorce that property owned prior to marriage isn't included. Maybe pay down the loan as much as possible and Refi? Last option is to try and get a lawyer to write up a postnup. My wife is probably less likely to be understanding during such trying times. Also any divorces willing to discuss how you recovered.

Financials aside I feel like everything I've worked for my life is falling apart. My biggest push to retire early was to spend time with my wife and child and now it seems like I'm losing everything, wife and child will be gone, as well as my ability to retire and my reason to...

And to the unmarried crowd.... no one gets married with the intent of divorce. I love my wife to pieces even as we are going through these hard times but people change and unfortunately she doesn't feel the same way towards me as she once did. I would suggest a prenup to every and anyone. It would make a lot more sense to divide assets while things are good instead of when things are bad.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

He switched from a soul-crushing job which he hated to something that was much more easy going (even though it paid less).

It made me think about the following concept:

**How much of our happiness do we sacrifice by working?**

Before the switch, this poster sacrificed a lot of his happiness for his job, and he was completely miserable because of it. Reading from his post, no salary would be able to justify that huge sacrifice. So he switched.

Now he has a job that's still slightly boring, but the happiness sacrifice is far less and it seems from his post that he's much happier since he made the switch.

I have been VERY intrigued by this concept of happiness vs. work/salary. That's why I wanted to start a discussion here.

I have opened Microsoft paint and created [this graph to help get the ball rolling](https://imgur.com/a/74gQ3sL).

To use the same example as before, the old job of the previous reddit post was probably far above the linear line: Yes, it may have earned more, but (s)he was suffering every day because of that old job. His/her new job is in much better territory, despite paying less. (correct me if I'm wrong, u/ispace888 ! ;-))

I want to ask all of you to determine where your current job is located on this chart. And as a follow-up, I'd like to ask how strongly you are pursuing FIRE. I bet the people who are in the red area on this chart are trying to reach FIRE much quicker, and thus have a higher saving rate.

**As for me:**

I've been pretty happy at my work over the last 3.5 years. Being the engineer that I am, I have gone ahead and [analysed just how happy I am at work in this essay](https://www.trackinghappiness.com/happy-at-work/). **TLDRL:** My work can be quite boring, stressful and intensive at times, but overall, I know that the impact on my happiness is not that big (0.12 points). This is why I am actually pretty happy with my job and salary. As a result, I'm not saving as aggresively as some others here are. Yes, I'm still frugal and aiming to become financially independent, but I'm not aggresively saving towards early retirement (or at least not yet!).

I would love to start a discussion here on this topic, and see where the r/fire community is located on this happiness-sacrifice vs. salary chart. Hell, it'd be amazing if we could create a big community-filled scatter chart with each and every one of your jobs, but I guess that's just me being a dreamer ;-)

What do you think?

Update: Thanks r/fire for the MANY insights, anecdotes and stories. With a bit of effort, I might actually be able to create that scatter after all. Keep the data points coming :D

* 33 years old, married with kids, living in the San Francisco Bay Area
* Job: Overpaid engineer at a Silicon Valley tech company
* Annual household income: $250k-300k, which is $150k salary plus $100-150k stock and bonus
* Annual expenses: About $65k, with half of that going towards rent for a run-down 2-bedroom duplex that's 18 miles from work (sigh, Bay Area housing...)
* Assets: $1.4M invested in 50&amp;#37; VTSAX, 30&amp;#37; VTIAX, and 20&amp;#37; VBTLX, plus $70k cash. Investments are held in roughly 50&amp;#37; taxable and 50&amp;#37; tax-advantaged (401k, IRAs, HSA) accounts.

Tomorrow is a special Monday for me, because it's the beginning of what will hopefully be the last full-time work week in my life. Ever since my first kid was born a few years ago I've really struggled with managing my time and have found it nearly impossible to balance work, parenting, spending time with my spouse, my own personal interests/hobbies, and various other responsibilities. I'm incredibly fortunate to have a massive income and a fairly average lifestyle, which has led to me saving a lot of money in relatively little time.

At work I'll be dropping to 80&amp;#37; time and will no longer work on Fridays, so every weekend will be a three day weekend. This comes with a pay cut, but I have enough money saved up at this point that I feel like it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the money I'm giving up would have been taxed at the highest rate, so while my gross pay will decrease by 20&amp;#37; my net pay will decrease by less than that.

While 80&amp;#37; time sounds nice I know that I want more, and I'll be attempting to drop to 60&amp;#37; time soon. One thing I've realized is that my savings gives me a lot of negotiating power - if management is not willing to go to 60&amp;#37; time then I have the freedom to quit and find another job that will allow me to work at 60&amp;#37;. Additionally my department recently lost a bunch of people for various reasons (transfers to other parts of the company, people quitting, medical issues, etc.) so we're now very understaffed, which I think will give me even more negotiating power.

While I would like to completely stop working for at least a year or two (possibly forever!), I'm hesitant to do that right now for a few reasons. First, I'm not quite FI yet - I would be if I moved to a LCOL area, but I'd prefer to live in a MCOL area. Another year or two of saving money should be all I need, and while I could get there a bit faster by continuing to work full-time I've just reached a point where I feel like I need to scale back on work for my own sanity.

Second, the health insurance situation in the US continues to be wildly unstable and unpredictable. I can currently afford to buy insurance out of pocket with ACA subsidies, but I don't want to put my family in a position where we'd be in trouble if those subsidies were no longer available to us. We're very lucky to have Canadian citizenship in case healthcare becomes a massive problem, but moving to Canada is something we'd really like to avoid if possible.

Finally, I know that the current bull market must come to an end eventually, and if possible I'd prefer to work through the next market crash. I'm not completely set on this and may stop working before the crash if it takes more than a few years to happen, but if possible that's what I'd prefer to do.

My view of FI has changed a lot over the years. When I first learned about the concept all I could think about was early retirement - I wanted to quit working as soon as possible and never work again. I still feel that way to some extent, but I'm realizing that there's more than that to FI and that having the freedom to try something different (work part-time, take a less stressful job, etc.) is also an incredible benefit. It's really about having the financial freedom to do what you want and try different things instead of being locked into a career for several decades. And who knows, maybe once my kids are in school I'll feel less busy and decide that I want to spend my time working again :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, in my case, inheritance is also a -significant- and material factor which shapes the bigger picture. 

All of the following has been extensively and explicitly discussed as part of an ongoing family discussion on how to create and grow generational wealth for me and my brother's families. 

Some of this has been discussed with estate planning lawyers, some of it has not. I'm getting lots of conflicting information and it's starting to get overwhelming. I feel more confused than when I started.

For context and simplicity, let's start with the inheritance.

**INHERITANCE**

My parents (around 60) are sole owners of a medical practice which has cleared approx. $1-2MM in annual profit over the past decade. They have purchased and will be expanding into a much larger building this year, where they hope to both increase profits by increasing their patient base, as well as by leasing out the rest of the building (the building has been paid in full). They hope to continue to work for another 10-15 years and shift into more management-oriented roles.

As non-physicians, my brother and I are prohibited from owning the medical practice upon their passing. The current plan is that they will try to sell their business in advance of their passing in order to monetize their current patient base, operations, etc.

Current liquid holdings are actually quite low (&lt;$1MM), but given current performance of the business and assuming their health holds, there's likely to be another $20-30MM in liquid holdings. 

Already established are several trusts to distribute the non-liquid assets (primarily real estate currently worth ~$15MM) between my brother and I, as well as an irrevocable life insurance trust to provide immediate liquidity for taxes.

&gt; **QUESTIONS:**

* When should they consider selling their business? How long does a sale of this type of business typically take? How would they find buyers? What would constitute a fair market value for the business (building not included)?

* Are there any good alternatives to a sale? 

* There's been no established plan on what to do re: earnings over the next 10-15 years + sales proceeds. What are some strong options to limit the tax burden, given everything else? 


**OUR PERSONAL JOURNEY**

Married couple (30 &amp; 28), total annual income of ~ $275K (depending on bonuses and equity vesting)

Two young kids, 3 and 1

Total current NW of $1.0MM

$470k investments across a mix of Roth &amp; traditional 401ks, and non-tax-advantaged accounts

$330K cash (I know)

$200k home equity

$300K in remaining mortgage debt (FWIW), no other outstanding debt

Currently no college savings for the kids - grandparents have established a 529.

Goal is to retire around 50 with around $4-5MM in NW (reasonably achievable)

&gt; **QUESTIONS:**

* We are aiming for a &lt;3% SWR out of our own nest egg. We also plan on taking very little out of the inheritance and letting it grow - maybe 0.5% SWR. Given that situation, does that make any difference in whether I should be funding a Roth vs. a traditional 401K?

* I will do my best to ensure my kids are not entitled dipshits, so I'm not overly concerned about transferring wealth to them. However, I don't know how much grandkids and great grandkids will turn out. Can I set up a trust that provides distributions contingent on factors (e.g. employment, college education, no violent felonies) indefinitely? What the fuck **is** the actual deal with the rule against perpetuities?

* How much protection do prenups actually offer in regards to trust distributions?

&gt; Prenuptial agreements, commonly known as prenups, are legal documents that outline how engaged couples will divide their assets if they divorce. And, in recent years, more millennials have been requesting them, according to a survey of matrimonial lawyers.
&gt; 
&gt; One likely reason: Millennials are marrying later than previous generations, with years to build up assets and debt on their own. “I got married at 23, so we put nothing and nothing together,” said Louis Cannataro, partner and founder of Cannataro Park Avenue Financial, where he has advised dozens of millennial clients on their prenups. “But when someone’s getting married in their 30s, there’s a different approach.”
&gt; 
&gt; That approach accounts for the changing role of women in the work force, too. In 1980, just 13 percent of women who lived with a male partner earned at least half the couple’s income — today, that number has nearly tripled.
&gt; 
&gt; So while prenups traditionally protected the party with money — which often was the man, and which often led to resentment — millennials usually tackle the agreements as a team.

With many people predicting a bear market and potential market correction I was wondering if you prefer a certain percent allocation for your investments.

I've read many people recommending 100% equity, especially early into one's career. I have also read that if you hold say 25% bonds you could re-allocate during a recession. But it seems like this method is only effective if there is a significant crash (ie 40% drop) and you take an all equity position near the bottom.

If you just re-balanced to 75/25 exquities/bonds and waited for the market to get back to pre correction levels you wouldn't make that much. 

For example if you have 200k with a 75/25 split and market drops 40% and bonds remain unchanged you have 105k in equity, 50k bonds left. Then if you re allocate at the bottom (this is hard to do) you end with 210k once market recovers. 

Alternatively if you went 100% equities, we only need to look at that 25% (50k) and see how many years it takes to make 10k. It would be about 3 years to make 10k based on rough estimates.

Major corrections seem to happen every 10 years so based on the above assumptions we are way better off being 100% equities unless we are heading into retirement soon.

Sorry if this has been asked before and please correct me if I am wrong in the above scenario.

As a physician, I am wondering how other high income, FIRE minded people approach this.  

One approach seems to look at disability as an income replacement.  The benefit obviously is a higher payout if the benefit is needed. The con is obviously higher premiums that are wasted if the goal is to maximize early savings/investment. 

From a FIRE perspective, with aggressive savings, hopefully I will not be forever dependent on my current income.  Our current expenses is probably 40% of our take home pay.  as a healthy 40 year old, the premium quote I have gotten from Guardian is slightly more than 5% of coverage amount (the premium was shockingly high number for me.. would probably make it my number 2 expense after housing).

**Benefit amount** - maxing out vs. obtaining enough to cover current expenses

**Waiting period** - 90 days or longer?  - I am thinking about extending it out to 180 days.. ie: self insuring for a few more months to decrease the out of pocket premiums seems to make sense

**Benefit period** - 65 or 70? premiums go up dramatically for 70, so I will probably take 65 - anyone consider taking even less? (if thats even possible)

**Residual disability** - thoughts on whether this is worth it? it will kick in if I am not able to work at my predisability level (ie: less hours, etc)

**Future increase option** - Is this worth it? Since I get coverage through my current employer I only qualify for about 1/2 of what I am eligible for. I can survive comfortably off the amount i qualify for and the premium extra for this option is ~13% of the base rate. If I change jobs, I can either live with the existing coverage or hope my new employer has group coverage. 



**Catastrophic rider** - I am considering it - it bumps up my monthly benefit for certain catastrophic illnesses (which is what i am insuring against)

**3% cost of living** - will probably take

**Level vs graded premium** - While level seems to make sense, I am considering the possibility that if I achieve FIRE within 10 years, could i consider cancelling the policy to save on the premiums? The break even point seems to be around 8 or 9 years for the level vs graded premiums. 

Is disability something that you would keep even once you FIRE? (there is high chance I would probably go to part time rather than RE entirely if given the chance)

Any thoughts about disability insurance regarding FIRE would be greatly appreciated!

I am a first-gen emigrant, finally got my NIW and on the way to citizenship. I do not have any relatives or accumulated money. The same with my spouse. We worked hard to get our degrees (both PhD), then worked for universities. We have very specific specializations and we were lucky to land jobs in the same city (NY) with extreme cost of life.
 
So for now we have 120K yearly. Around 91K after tax. We do not contribute to IRA/ROTH (only employer match). It is not top salaries in our industries, but after 2.5 years of being on job market, it seems like our top early income can be ~150K if we will get lucky and land a job in cheaper place (taking into account how tiny the job market for our specialization). It seems like we will never retire.

For now, rent, utilities, childcare, gas and insurance take off ~$65000 every year. We were able to accumulate $26000 on our saving account from 2014. When we moved to NY, it drained our credit cards and we went $4000 down, then we paid $6000 for emergency hospital bills, so now we have $16000 saved. No loans or debts.

The current shapshot of our financial picture:

* Assets:
   * **Cash: $28k**
      * E-Fund: $16.5k
      * Savings: $9.2k
      * Checking: $2.3k

      * Roth IRAs: $32k
      * Taxable: $10k
   * **House: $285k**
* Debts
   * **Mortgage: -$205k**

We're both 28, and just had our first child. Up until this point, we've been focusing on increasing savings and cutting costs, to hit $200k NW, and $100k invested. Now that we hit our goal, I want to make sure that we don't lose momentum or take a step in the wrong direction. 

Our plan is to save/invest as much as we comfortably can, so that we can retire comfortably -- and earlier if possible. Currently, I contribute \~$11k to my 401(k), and we both max our Roth IRAs. Should we focus on increasing the 401(k) contribution to the maximum allowed, or point our efforts more towards a 529, and the taxable account? We'd love to have the house paid off, but at &lt;4&amp;#37; I don't think that it's the best use of our money. 

I think we've been so focused on hitting this goal, that we don't quite know what to do now. Any suggestions on mini-goals or milestones that may help provide some constant motivation?
