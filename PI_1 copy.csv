We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Track all spending!** It is important to track your spending to avoid having lifestyle inflation sneak up on you (even if you are financially comfortable). If you don't know where your money is going, you can't make intelligent choices about spending and allocating your money for maximum benefit. Here are some tips to get you started:

* Select your tools. Anything goes here and you should use whatever works for you. Options include pen and paper, spreadsheets, the [envelope method](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting#wiki_tools.2Fsystems), and websites and apps such as [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) and [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).

* Make a complete budget. Break your spending down into categories and capture 100% of your spending. A budget that doesn't cover major categories is not very useful and excessively broad categories can also muddy the waters. Budget categories for Savings, Retirement, Gifts, and Auto Maintenance are frequently overlooked, as are any yearly renewals or fees. You can review your past spending to check what has been grouped into ""miscellaneous"" spending for too long.

* Stay vigilant and be thorough. Track your spending daily and check how your budget categories are doing before making a purchase.

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done one or more of the following things:

* Completed at least 30 days of tracking your spending

* Added one category to an already existing budget.

* Shared a budgeting tool (not your own please!) in this thread.

A supervisor got involved, and after showing him texts/emails/and the ticket through ticketmaster, he looked into it. Apparently this guy has been buying single tickets, selling them as a pair and ghosting with the money. 

Sadly, they couldn't do anything to help me, I'd have to buy 2 new tickets. Which I didn't do as I'd already spent $150.

My next step, though I highly doubt they'd help is contact my bank and see if they can undo the sale, I paid via quick pay with Chase. I figure the worst they could say is no, and this is a costly lesson.

## Question

I have contacted my insurance company but since I don't have collision insurance on the Golf, they will contact me when the police report is filed so I can file a claim. My neighbor has homeowners insurance and has called a lawyer.

**What happens if this kid has minimum coverage (or no coverage) and it runs out before everything is covered?** My neighbor's home is more important to me than my car, despite how much I enjoy it and what it means to me. Plus, I know I'm in the hole either way if the frame is damaged. I'll never get what I paid since it's in a semi-niche market and depreciation is atypical. 

Is there anything else I should do?

## Background

After a college ball game, some dumpster fire hit my wife's car, then my car, then over-corrected and slammed into the front of my neighbor's house. It was the first cool night in a while, and one of their good boys was sleeping outside. He went under the car, and was pinned under the car against the house. He was probably further injured when the driver tried to flee the scene and dragged him out a few feet. They had to put him down later in the day. I still don't know why the airbags didn't deploy, I guess the house absorbed most of the impact. The first floor wall was was pushed in enough to trap Mr Neighbor in the living room and Mrs Neighbor upstairs.

I was the first one there until a few more neighbors started showing up, followed by police, etc. I was out in the rain in my underwear helping dig the dog out of the rubble and helping calm down the homeowners/dogparents until first responders arrived. Once the pros were on scene, I went and got dressed and started looking for additional damage. I remembered hearing smaller crashes before the big one, it turns out he hit my wife's and my car before crashing into the house.

My wife bought her car new in 2012, and has collision insurance on it, and has damage to the rear fender and bumper end. I think we are okay with her car. 

My car is older, and very likely totalled. Hindsight is 20/20 and I should have put collision on it. I saved up for a little under a year (thanks PF and YNAB!) and finally paid cash for my dream car* in July. The driver hit my front wheel pretty hard and clearly pushed it in. The control arm is broken, and I'm worried there was structural damage to engine mounts or the frame. It's been pouring for three days, so I haven't been under the car yet.

So, I'm no expert, but he destroyed a load bearing wall on a 60+ year old home. The addition is leaking (opposite side of the home) which suggests significant damage. They are no longer able to open their basement door near the crash site. This house might need to be rebuilt, but either way I'd guess a minimum of $100k on repairs on a house barely worth that much. Not to mention they are very likely to sue for emotional damages for loss of their dog. They are also the type of people likely to seek a payout in most situations, so there's that.

*For anyone interested: five speed, 2004 VW Golf TDI GLS. Single owner and garaged in Texas with under 100k miles. If you know imports and diesels, you know this car is worth more than Kelly Blue Book says it is and would have lasted me another 200k miles or more. I happily paid $7500 for it as it had brand new rubber and a brand new clutch and flywheel (about a $3000 work order). I was averaging 32MPG in city traffic, and 45MPG on highway, where my truck gets about 21/17. I love this car, and it's the first vehicle I've ever owned that I was proud of.

PayPal called me telling me I had a negative balance of 1,596 dollars.

So, before I call them back (I am not accepting incoming calls from them so I can be sure it’s actually them), do I have options?. There is no way in hell I can afford to pay them 1600 bucks, and even if there was, there is no way in hell I would.

 Yolanda tells me it will take 4-6 weeks for her to get the police report and decide. So I wait a bit and check online only to find that the claim is closed and no vehicle damage was reported.

I call Yolanda back and am a bit confused. Voicemail again... I leave a message and wait. She calls me back and I ask what's the status with the case. She tells me we have never talked. I tell her we have and she sturnly says no we haven't. I tell her I have voicemails from her and I can send them to her. She says that won't be necessary... I'm irritated now

Yolanda tells me they decided that the fire department is at fault and they won't be paying for anything for my vehicle. WTF! We go back and forth nothing gets settled. Yolanda even suggests that I contact the department and get them to cover the damages. 

They also suggest I just use my own insurance to fix it. All I have to pay is my deductible... I only have liability insurance and will have to pay out of pocket just to fix my truck.

WTF! I get rear ended, I stopped in time, she didn't! It wasn't a drag race. Now they won't me to do all the work? Da hell is insurance for?

Also, I went to get my inspection so I can register my vehicle and forgot that it is impossible to pass inspection in Texas when you have a busted tail light even though the lights still work

What can/should I do?

We both have Geico
The report says it's her fault but also says firetruck was the cause of my sudden braking

&amp;#x200B;

My company is about to be acquired, within the next 6 months or so. I have been at this job for 4 years and have been promoted once thus far. I am a top performer at work consistently. I am also a subject matter expert in a specialized area, and the only person who can do about 40% of my job duties (i.e. if I quit, they would be screwed). I have 8 years experience in this department, 12 in industry. I make low six figures with a 15 % annual bonus, which I always hit, sometimes exceed.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been interviewing at another company for a role that would be a great step up in my career, but it has been dragging for 2 months now, and I am not sure if I will be selected/I can't bank on that/nor can I use it to negotiate before this signed agreement is due back to my employer.

&amp;#x200B;

People have been quitting en masse at my company and within my department. We are having trouble replacing people, because who wants to come work for a company that won't exist in a few months (plus our reputation is not that great as of late in the industry circles)? I am worried that at least two of my coworkers in my group will quit before this year is over, thus increasing my own workload significantly. I have 2 people who work for me who could be laid off/I know they will not get a retention offer, which would also increase my workload.

&amp;#x200B;

So, last week the head of my department offered me a retention bonus. It is about 9 months salary, paid in one lump sum, upon completion of a fixed term (through December 2019). I will get the check 30 days after. I will still get the money if the acquisition falls through. I will still get the money (within 90 days) if I am laid off before December. I am still eligible for my normal severance package/this offer has no bearing on severance.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I would be dumb NOT to sign it, so I plan to. However, I am wondering if I should ask for more. They clearly need me. If I were to quit, they would need to hire a consultant to do a large chunk of my work, in order to meet external deadlines (think government obligations/laws that will not let them postpone this work).

&amp;#x200B;

I was mulling over asking for more. I could ask for:

* **A promotion** (I am already doing the level of work of the next rank above me, due to department reorganization last year, however I have not gotten the title nor the salary bump)
* **More money** (12 mo salary? I do feel like the 9 mo offer is already generous)
* **Stock options** (I already have a decent amount of stock that is somewhat worthless, might change after acquisition)
* **An extra week of vacation** (I can likely work this out with my boss directly, to be taken before end of this year/while he is still my boss)

&amp;#x200B;

While I do not want to be greedy, I know the next 15 months is going to suck. I do love my job, and my boss is amazing. I will be working 50-70 hours a week during the busy months in 2019, I will be staying on a sinking ship longer than a lot of other people in my department. My company is desparate to retain high performers. If there is opportunity to get more, I would like to at least try. I will still sign the offer if they say no to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

**ETA: I will not quit if they say no; I will still sign the document and stay. I want to REQUEST more, not negotiate. Sorry about the incorrect terminology!**

Bare bones 2018 Hyundai Elantra

Payment was $185.00

Progressive values the car at $15,415
Was rear-ended by an uninsured driver
GAP coverage in included in my payment.


My questions are as follows:

Does this mean i negotiated a good or bad deal given gap insurance does not come into play? 
I ask this because i am now face with acquiring a new vehicle and am trying to determine how to best go about it.

If this was a good deal should i contact Hyundai to see if they can give me the same deal? (Not wanting to have to pay for Tax, title etc etc up front again) If not... what should i do?

Should I/ Can I sue for the deductible and or the cost of acquiring another car? Unfortunately I like most people do not have the means to come up with funds for another less than a month after starting a lease.

&lt;p&gt;If this was a good deal should i contact Hyundai to see if they can give me the same deal? (Not wanting to have to pay for Tax, title etc etc up front again) If not... what should i do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I/ Can I sue for the deductible and or the cost of acquiring another car? Unfortunately I like most people do not have the means to come up with funds for another less than a month after starting a lease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any suggestions, help, or input.&lt;/p&gt;

I got really bad food poisoning ~3 months ago. I held out until I was unable to hold down water and I'd begun dry heaving and knew i was severely dehydrated and realized I needed to get fluids fast. 
I got to the urgent care who immediately referred me to the ER. when getting into the ER, they got me in a bed and i laid down, had my stomach xrayed and they verified it was terrible food poisoning. they gave me 2 bags of saline and an anti-nausea med, i was sent home with nothing more. 

I have since received multiple statements and bills from the hospital, all totaling to ~1400 dollars. this weekend, i received yet another statement (with a spot for payment, so maybe it's an invoice?)  for 8 thousand dollars. 

I have VA insurance, but the itemized line shows they covered nothing (i live over an hour from the closest VA hospital, so it was not an option.) 

I'm wondering a few things - 
1. is there any way to contest with the VA that they cover some of these costs? if so, where to begin?

2. do hospitals finance these types of situations? (i literally make 2 dollars more than minimum wage and am already scraping by. my car needs work, I'm very stressed by this situation, I don't know if calling the hospital billing department will even help)

3. is it worth considering just not paying this and letting it tank my credit and waiting for it to drop off? 

are there other ideas I'd not considered here? I'm thinking I need to talk to the hospital to make sure I have all the info straight on what exactly I owe and the due date (there have been many invoices, some from a billing agency called Akron Billing Center) and I'm worried what I'm paying and who to now that I've gotten mail from the actual hospital.

Next year I'll be graduating from an engineering school with a major in software/system engineering, which will hopefully permit me to earn something like 35~40K€ per year.

I live in France so I don't have any student debt to deal with, and as of today I have saved 6K€ from student job. I know it's not much but it's a start.

One would be rented, and the rent would be set in order to repay one loan each month.  Hopefully after 20~25 years both loans would be paid off, the apartments will have gained in value and will be providing a stable income.

In your opinion, is it manageable and/or worth the risk ?

This weekend I checked my bank account and they had pulled almost $1200 out in one transaction, leaving me overdrawn and empty handed.

I finally contacted them today and they explained that they'd been accidentally paying me small amounts over the last few months in $20 - $100 amounts. These small deposits went unnoticed and I rarely check where money is coming from into my account as I work multiple temp jobs as well as modeling projects and expenses that are constantly filtering into my bank account.

Now with them pulling the $1200 out of my account it's left me in a really tough spot and I'm not sure if I have any path to opening a conversation with them on a more reasonable path to action. Can I request a reversal from my bank and ask the job to set up a more reasonable repayment plan? Is what they've done common?

Saw a car listing I was interested in, went and looked at it, drove and looked great, so I went and got cash from the bank and bought it. This was at about 11:30 am. They closed at noon because it's Saturday. I headed home and made it 64 miles before the transmission went out and left me sit on the side of the highway. I had it towed back to the car lot because I was a heck of a lot closer to there than home, and then my wife took me the rest of the way (she was following me in our minivan with our kids.) 

My question is, what are my odds on a refund on this thing? I signed a document saying it was being sold as is, but this is a private dealer and has the guys name on the sign. I guess I'm hoping he has some integrity and cuts me a break considering I didn't even get to drive the thing for an hour. I also took all this money out of my savings so I'll be pretty bummed if it's just a complete loss. A transmission is completely out of the question to replace on this car. 

Thoughts? I probably won't hear from this guy until Monday so I have to stew about it until then.

Edit: I live I Indiana if that matters.

Edit 2: Guy just called me and the first thing out of his mouth was that he was refunding my money. Said he was sorry and not a crook about 15 times. Guess there really are some good people left in the world.

Final edit: Just got home with my refund as it was a 5 hour round trip. Guy was extremely apologetic and even told me he wasn't legally obligated to do anything but he thought it was the right thing to do. He said he would have sold that car to a family member and was shocked that it happened. To all of you who were telling me to buy him a bottle of something, I am already out a few hundred dollars for the tow bill, not to mention I filled the tank to the brim before it broke. I lost a decent chunk too. Guy said he's not going to scrap it, he has too much money into it now so he's just going to replace yhe the transmission. (it had 4 new tires, a new battery and two front wheel bearings just finished) I told him if he can find me something else I will make the drive again to give him business.

I have collected a lot of debt during my college years.

I started tracking my expenses to work on my budgeting. I'm not sure what to pay off first and I also need tremendous help on rebuilding my credit. Any tips/suggestions are greatly provided!!

Questions I have:
1. I have $15k saved to start paying off any of the above. My thought is to pay off my credit cards first and then start on my loans. Thoughts? Suggestions?
2. Should I consolidate my loans? Is there a recommended company anyone has (preferably someone who would work with bad credit)?
3. What are some ways I can start rebuilding my credit?

I would greatly appreciate if anyone could help provide insights, tips, suggestions, recommendations, anything!! I was thinking of meeting with a financial advisor, but thought to reach out to the reddit community first.

I budget, I don't over spend, I buy what I can afford when I can afford it. Most of my money goes to providing for my kids, gas, groceries, and because of raise of cost of living here that has been even more difficult to do. 

My trouble began when my ex wife (who only interacts with the kids when she feels like it) out of the blue requested that she wanted to take the kids for the summer, she lived in St. Louis and I lived in Denver. I used my savings to get them out there, drop them off, and come back home. I get a phone call a few weeks into their trip stating she needed money for groceries, I send her some because I wanted my kids to be taken care of. I get a call right before school starts that she will not be able to bring them home, so now I have to decide between bills and getting my kids. No contest, I drive and get them and come back.

I am now behind on bills, my credit card is maxed (2k, only had it for emergencies), I still had to pay for the kids school supplies, new clothes, haircuts (they didn't have one the entire time they where there), lunches, and school fees. I am also now making late payments on my mortgage every month which undermines my refi on my home, I make a payment plan with Wells Fargo, this has devastated my credit dropping it down to a 545 last time I checked. 

I need some help figuring out how to get back on my feet. I have sacrificed everything (my security clearance, high paying defense contracting jobs, finishing my degree) to be there for my kids, but I am feeling super stretched thin, super depressed, and like I am a failure.

Since I finished school, I was a good boy, went and got a degree, went straight into a related field (finance) and was earning close to 100k by 24. I grew tired of the lack of fulfilling work finance provides.

A friend worked with a large retailer here in Australia that was growing aggressively. He asked if I’d like to join for about a 40% pay cut. I did because the earning potential was there with a profit share style agreement. I excelled quickly and opened up a new store within 3 months. 6 months after that I was promoted to oversee 3 states and 50% of the shops in Australia. I poured my soul into the role, sacrificing virtually anything for success. 

We achieved short term success but my mental state deteriorated to a state where my family and friends were worried. I stepped out of the role/was pushed out. I am now back to looking after a single store. I enjoy the people but I am struggling to not think about the amazing world out there full of possibilities to use my skill set. However I can’t just apply for a high level management role like I used to hold, at my age I have been told several times that the staff pool won’t respond well.

Ultimately I need advice on what to do. Is a job in a field you are passionate about truly that much better where pay doesn’t matter? 
Is 12k enough to take a summer off and find my mojo again? Would there be ways to earn a supplementary income?

I have the following loans:

Car Loan: \~$16,580 at 3.9% with a monthly minimum of 350 a month. 

Student Loan: \~25,600 (interest rates ranging from 3.76% to 4.66%) that is in grace until November. After the grace period, I expect the minimum to be around $200.

Car: $400 a month

Loans: $650 a month

What I am currently doing puts me debt free in about 4 years (assuming current rates don’t change at all)

The pragmatic part of me thinks I should do the Avalanche method moving my car to $350 a month, and putting the extra $50 towards loans, until the loans with interest rates above 3.9% are paid off, and once all loans above 3.9% are paid off, paying \~$850 towards my car.

I recently got my master's degree is statistics (May 2018) and started working for a company near my hometown (low cost of living area).  I make 65k a year plus bonuses (expected to be around 4k).  Take home pay is \~3200/month.  The problem is the large amount of student loans I'm paying off. Currently putting 6% into my 401k to get my company match (currently has 1k after 2 months of working).  So here are my expenses:

&amp;#x200B;

Housing: I live with my mom right now, so maybe 100/month for things here and there

Gas/car: 100-140 because I drive a lot ( I have never financed a car, and this one has 140k miles so it's got time)

Gym: 70/month (mma gym so planet fitness at $10 isn't an option)

Internet: 60/month

Transfer into savings: 500/month (my costs are low right now so I'm building my emerg. fund a little slower)

&amp;#x200B;

\-53k in Feds, some around 4%,  42k 6%

\-2 private loans totaling 12000 , one at 4%, one at 11.25% with 5700 left (It was 9000 back in June, variable interest, I know)

&amp;#x200B;

So the reason I'm here is to check with you all about my payoff strategy.  All my feds are in grace until November, which let's me pay extra to my privates.  I'm trying to be super aggressive about this.  Each month I pay the $100 minimum on the lower interest loan.  Every PAYCHECK, I drop $1000 into the higher interest loan.  I think it's pretty clear that's the first step, but what should I do after I kill that 11 percenter?   I'm open to all options, but currently considering refinancing just the 42k at 6% and getting an extended payoff option on the lower interest loans so I can throw more at the highest interest ones.  The big thing here is that I obviously can't pay this much into loans forever, and I want to start planning for  my future.  So to you gurus I ask:

&amp;#x200B;

\-once the bad loan is gone, should I increase my payment into savings?

\-at what point in this journey should I allocate more money into 401k/Roth IRA instead of loans?

\-I would like to buy a house eventually.  In my area you can find single family homes for 40k-60k, should I do anything special for that?  My credit is 740, I never carry a balance, and my score is steadily increasing with age and my loan payoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone!

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, throwaway for privacy, but a long time subscriber.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got my master&amp;#39;s degree is statistics (May 2018) and started working for a company near my hometown (low cost of living area).  I make 65k a year plus bonuses (expected to be around 4k).  Take home pay is ~3200/month.  The problem is the large amount of student loans I&amp;#39;m paying off. Currently putting 6% into my 401k to get my company match (currently has 1k after 2 months of working).  So here are my expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing: I live with my mom right now, so maybe 100/month for things here and there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas/car: 100-140 because I drive a lot ( I have never financed a car, and this one has 140k miles so it&amp;#39;s got time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gym: 70/month (mma gym so planet fitness at $10 isn&amp;#39;t an option)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet: 60/month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer into savings: 500/month (my costs are low right now so I&amp;#39;m building my emerg. fund a little slower)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And honestly that&amp;#39;s about it.  So now for debts and investments.  I&amp;#39;ve been working since the end of June so here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;quot;m at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-53k in Feds, some around 4%,  42k 6%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-2 private loans totaling 12000 , one at 4%, one at 11.25% with 5700 left (It was 9000 back in June, variable interest, I know)&lt;/p&gt;

I won a sweepstakes from Marlboro for a $35000 travel voucher. It seems like a blessing, but more a curse.

It looks like the tax alone could be about a third of that amount (which I cannot afford). 

Also, I'm an unmarried, stay-at-home parent. Since my income is $0 annually, I get insurance covered by the state (MN). I believe that accepting the travel voucher would count as income, even though it's not cash, thus my insurance benefits would go down without having an actual income to supplement the lesser coverage. 

I'm trying to gauge how accurate the information I've gotten is, and what options—if any—I have to make this work to my benefit. Otherwise, I'll give up on it. 

I only have 7 days from notification of winning (3 days now) to sign the form online to confirm acceptance.

* HCOL area
* 3200 Sq. Ft. 4 bedroom/4 bath. Modern finishes. Great flat yard on a cul de sac
* On the upper end of the market for the neighborhood but by no means the top. Area is rapidly gentrifying
* Good elementary schools but poor middle/high schools. Will likely need to move in 10 years unless things change. Private school is also an option.
* Built in 2013. Well maintained. Visual walkthrough by contractor showed no red flags
* 2 adults, 1 infant, 1 toddler

The offer:
* 1.365m (list price was 1.35 but we suspect there will be multiple offers)
* Will waive inspection

Our financial situation:
* 470k combined base income split evenly between the two adults. Other bonuses and stuff are also there but we don't really count those as they are variable.
* Down payment is a bit less than half of our assets not tied up in retirement accounts or unvested company stock
* There is a possibility that I could lose my job in the next 12 months. I would be well take care of if this happened but it would impact cash flow. I anticipate finding another similar paying job could take up to a year. My wife has a lot of job security.

I never thought I would spend this much money on a house but unfortunately it is the cost of entry into the market for SFHs. Do these numbers add up to you guys? Do you think I am crazy for purchasing a house when there is a chance my employment could come to an end? How much does upkeep on a relatively new, efficient home of this size equal?

See below for background info.  (Posting for husband who is a very lax redditor)


My husband got the job he really wanted and one he had a small hand in creating/molding. They matched his current salary (unintentional. I don’t think they actually knew it). However this job requires 50% travel (1-2 days per week). On his offer they don’t include any travel (car maintenance and hotel, etc) costs. 

The offer also did not include an in-depth benefits summary. We want to look it completely over before he signs. Especially since we are expecting our second child next February.  It was basically a one page document with a VERY brief over view of the job. And to be fair, this position is brand new to them so I think they’re head scratching too. Husband works with one of the plant managers through his current job and they realized there was a big need for this type of role and husband filled all the categories needed. I believe he could easily negotiate a large pay raise to cover travel expenses and car upkeep (they will not have a fleet vehicle for him). I told him absolutely not to sign the current offer of employment until he sees more info. We don’t even know little things like sick leave or PTO. We know they do retirement matching but nothing specific...? 

When he’s not traveling he will work from home and they’ve stated intent to pay WiFi and appropriate computer set up. So I feel good about that. But I’m nervous about the pay. I know even though the salary is the same we’d make less with all the extraneous expenses added up. 

I’ve suggested he make a spreadsheet detailing this and the costs associated with travel including mileage cost to the three plants he will travel most often too, etc. Not to mention food reimbursement, hotels, etc. We live centrally to the three plants he’d travel too (2.5, 6, 6 hour drives)

I guess I’m asking for tips on how to negotiate this. Seeing as this position was created for him. He has negotiated small raises before but nothing on this scale and for this to work he will need more $ to cover travel expenses for sure. 


Thoughts? Tips?

Update: we did get benefits package after request. Pretty decent. Monthly premiums are a bit pricey but the deductibles are low and we could keep our current providers.

First time poster here. 

I saw a post a couple of days ago about a Roth IRA. 
That has actually been something that I’ve been considering setting up. 

But of backstory, I have a 401k through my job but my husband doesn’t. He doesn’t have any benefits with his company since it’s a small company (6 employees total). We’ve been talking about setting up some sort of account similar to a 401k to prepare for retirement.

Roth IRA were some things that we were looking at but I think we also looked at mutual funds etc. 

We would probably start with about an initial $5,000. And then add more every paycheck( is that even possible?) 

Any help is appreciated!! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;HELLO! &lt;/p&gt;

That has actually been something that I’ve been considering setting up. &lt;/p&gt;

Car was 28k, put 3k down, which should have made the loan funded for 25k @4%. To be fair, at first the check was mistakenly written for 28k, I caught it and the finance guy at dealership wrote ""five"" and a ""5"" over the incorrect info. He assured me they would fund it the correct amount. We paid 3k via a cc (money was in bank but we wanted some rewards points. CC was instantly paid off the next day).

Fast forward to yesterday, I log in to see the loan has finally started showing up at my bank, the only problem is it's showing up for 28k. I contacted my banker and explain. She acknowledged they weren't 100% sure if it was a 5 or 8 so they contacted the dealership and asked them to send proof of what the amount should be. Dealership sent over something showing 28k and that's what they funded it on.

So I called the dealership, they without fuss acknowledged I paid the 3k and tried blaming the bank. Since the loan has funded they are mailing me a check for 3k. 

So the question is what to do with the 3k. My banker is seeing if they can somehow change the loan and I give them the 3k. My other option would be to pay off the remaining 2k I owe on a cc (15% interest). I've been dumping $300 a month onto that to get it paid off and it would be nice to be free and clear of that. It seems like a better option because 4% interest is much better than 15%. 

Doing that would likely keep me upside down on the car for a while. The bank offers gap insurance on the loan and I can see what State farm would charge for gap insurance as well if that seems like the better option. 

Either way, the payment on 28k isn't an issue even with the $300 going to my cc.

So I am wondering if I should cancle it after a year of usage (before I get chaeged the annual fee of $95)? How will this affect my credit score.

I would still like to get the Chase Reserve, but I am planning to wait about 6 months before doing an other inquery. (My score drop by about 10 - 25 points depending on which site I checked on)

Before anyone says anything, I’m aware this isn’t a great financial investment but it’s something I’m splurging on.

Here’s the situation:

Two cars currently, both with loans on them. 
* Car a has about 19k left on it and trade in value is 22,5000
* car b has about 37k left on it with an interest rate of 3.49%

The total amount for the Tesla is going to be about 115k after taxes and all that Jazz. I have the cash available to buy it outright but I’m not sure that’s the best use of my money.

Some background:

* make about 300k/year in base plus I get RSUs every year
* max out 401k, Roth, etc. also put a bunch into a 529 for my daughter 
* currently just dabble in stocks but have about 550k in RSUs at work that are vesting over the next couple of years
* been putting a bunch of money into home improvements so don’t have a ton invested in bonds, etc but will be doing more of that starting next year after we’re out of the home improvement dance 
* just cashed out 140k in vested RSUs and currently sitting on the cash (for about a week).
* the loan for the Tesla would be between 3 and 3.5% (interest rates have really gone up in the past few months)

Here are my options that I’m considering:

* A) buy the Tesla outright for cash while trading in car a
* B) put 20k down on the Tesla and invest the rest 
* C) put 50k down on the Tesla and invest the rest
* D) pay off car b, put 20k down on the Tesla and invest the rest

The initial reason I cashed out the RSUs was to diversify my portfolio but I’m leaning towards option A just to avoid the massive payment that comes with a 100k car loan.

So, finance gurus, which path would you pick? 

P.s. “not getting a Tesla” is not an option, I am picking up the car in a couple of weeks and it’s something I’ve been thinking about for years so I’m going to live a little and splurge.

However, after doing a little bit of research, I'm no where near sold yet.

The card has 50,000 point offer ($750 if use for travel) and 3% for travel/dining.  Then an extra 50% for points so it's 4.5 % if you use all those points towards travel.  This comes with a steep annual fee ($450) but you do get $300 is travel credit.  

All this sounds great but the other options are Citi Cash Back, Capital One Savor, and Wells Fargo Propel.

Citi cash back has a flat 2% with no annual fee.  This means I need to spend at minimum $6000 on travel/dining a year or $500 a month.  That's also assuming that all those points will be used towards travel but if I'm already spending $6000, then the $270 will be put to good use.  But this card does not have an offer bonus which would offset the annual fee for about 3 years so I'm not actually considering this one.

Let's look at the Capital One Savor.  4% dining and entertainment and 2% groceries.  This one has an annual fee of $95 but is waived the first year.  Granted, the difference between these is that the Savor has dining and entertainment and the CSR has dining and travel but just as it is, you need to spend at least $10k to break even.  Granted, travel costs more than entertainment but you'd either need to travel a lot more than entertainment to still break even.  Along with this, Savor also has a $500 offer which would cover the annual fee for 6 years compared to Reserve's 3.

Finally there is Wells Fargo Propel.  This has 3% on dining, travel, gas, and streaming services with no annual fee.  In order to break even, you'd need to spend 10k again on dining and travel.  Along with this, there is a $300 offer.  It's not as good at $500 but you also don't have any fees.  Even the Uber credit card competes with WF Propel with 4% dining, 3% travel, 2% online shopping with no fees.

I guess unless you are spending hundreds of dollars a month of dining and travel, I fail to see how the CSR remains so popular.  These cards that I've compared to provide great alternatives to the CSR yet everyone claims that this card remains one of the best out there.  I'm interested in anyone's insight here.

Edit:  I compared CSR to be 4.5% due to the 1.5 cent to point conversion for travel purchases.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking around for a new credit card and everyone says the the Chase Sapphire Reserve is one of the best credit cards out there.

It&amp;#39;s not as good at $500 but you also don&amp;#39;t have any fees.  Even the Uber credit card competes with WF Propel with 4% dining, 3% travel, 2% online shopping with no fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess unless you are spending hundreds of dollars a month of dining and travel, I fail to see how the CSR remains so popular.  These cards that I&amp;#39;ve compared to provide great alternatives to the CSR yet everyone claims that this card remains one of the best out there.  I&amp;#39;m interested in anyone&amp;#39;s insight here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  I compared CSR to be 4.5% due to the 1.5 cent to point conversion for travel purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

A close family friend of mine is selling her house for 115k ""as is"" and it needs a little work done. She bought it back in 2001 or so. She wants it gone ASAP because she just got back together with her husband and they don't want to pay for two houses. She is not listing the house (yet) and is offering it to friends and family first. If no family/friends want it, she's going to list it for 115k to get rid of it fast.

I know the area and the surrounding houses are currently selling for 180-210k. It is livable right now but does need some work but not a lot. Here are some details on the house.


**Here is what is brand new so doesn't need to be replaced**

 - New roof (3 years old)
 - Completely redone bathroom (1 year old)
 - AC unit (~3-5 years old)
 - Refrigerator
 - Wood flooring in living room/den


**Here is what has to be replaced**

 - Windows (house was built in 1969, they are the original ones)
 - Flooring in hallway (it was messed up when the bathroom had to be redone last year due to water damage, currently is cement)
 - Front door (big crazy dog) 


**List of things my wife and I would like to replace (not required)**

 - Preemptively line the pipes (no known issues, just wanna be prepared)
 - New kitchen cabinets/floors
 - Probably the fence, but not right away


**Question**

This would be our first house. In January my wife and I were pre-approved for 225k with 3% down (USAA) and 250k with 0% down (Navy Federal). I called USAA/Navy Federal and they said they do not offer mortgages with reno built in but my sister mentioned repair escrows. It seems to be exactly what we need because I don't have the cash to fix everything, but I know I can get a mortgage large enough to handle it.

What we are thinking is:

 - Buy house for 160k instead of 115k
 - Put the difference (45k) into repair escrow
 - Use that to fix the house

My wife and I were shopping 180-200k houses before this, so it looks like we'd come in under budget. Does this sound like a good idea? Am I misunderstanding a repair escrow? 

Thanks!

This typically goes up by 1-2k a month depending on whether or not we have big expenses or vacations.

We have three major debts:

1.) HELOC loan that I used against my paid-for home to purchase 5 acres of land. Loan has a present balance of around $80k, 6% interest. Monthly payments are about $750 but we always pay $1000

2.) Car note of around $450 a month, 3% interest. 25k remaking balance.

3.) Truck note of around $450 a month, 3% interest, 12k remaining balance.

My original plan was to save until I could pay off the HELOC loan in full with around 5-10k left in my savings. But now I wonder if I’m just paying all sorts of pointless interest by locked away all this money in a savings account that is only giving me about $5 a month in interest.

I know the idea of the snowball effect: I could pay off my two car notes and then start hammering away at the HELOC, but I think I’d only save about $1500 or so in interest between the two cars.

I could but 40-50k down on the HELOC but I don’t know how much that would effect my interest and I’d still be stuck with 3 debts.

&lt;p&gt;1.) HELOC loan that I used against my paid-for home to purchase 5 acres of land. Loan has a present balance of around $80k, 6% interest. Monthly payments are about $750 but we always pay $1000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Car note of around $450 a month, 3% interest. 25k remaking balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Truck note of around $450 a month, 3% interest, 12k remaining balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original plan was to save until I could pay off the HELOC loan in full with around 5-10k left in my savings. But now I wonder if I’m just paying all sorts of pointless interest by locked away all this money in a savings account that is only giving me about $5 a month in interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the idea of the snowball effect: I could pay off my two car notes and then start hammering away at the HELOC, but I think I’d only save about $1500 or so in interest between the two cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could but 40-50k down on the HELOC but I don’t know how much that would effect my interest and I’d still be stuck with 3 debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? &lt;/p&gt;

Hi and thanks for your time,

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting a new job which I am feeling extremely fortunate for, and which gives me a substantial salary increase from prior experiences. However, this has placed me in a position where I am struggling to find advice on how to invest. At my previous salary, my family and friends were able to give me excellent advice - they are all savers and quite frugal. However, this higher salary leaves me with many new questions, particularly in regards of how to maximize my tax-advantaged investing as well as how to invest after maxing these. 

&amp;#x200B;

My new salary is $210,000, with the opportunity for bonuses on top of this. Additionally, I am qualified for a $19-20k employer 403(b) contribution which does not mandate any matching contribution of my own. They also offer a 457(b) deferred compensation plan to help me max out and take advantage of the $55,000 limit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently am managing my expenses fine, and I could potentially budget to save &gt;$100,000 per year if I knew how best to do it. At present, I am planning to contribute the maximum of $18,500 to my 401k for this year, as well as take advantage of my employer contributions. Beyond that, my income is starting to just accumulate in my account, and I have not been able to decide what my next step should be. I have read about the mega backdoor Roth IRA which would allow me to funnel some of my earnings into a Roth IRA (which my salary otherwise makes me ineligible for). 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has experience or advice on where to start, I would appreciate it. Thanks

**What is Passive Investing:**

Passive investing is an investment strategy that focuses on long-term stability with minimum cost. The difference to active investing is that with active investing you try to beat to market by picking stocks and timing. This is very risky and there's typically more winners than loosers. With passive investing you'd buy and ETF or Index fund instead. This means that you can't get unusually high returns, but due to low fees you end up making a much smarter investment.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the best way to passivly invest?**

I've read that vanguard has some of the best low-cost Index funds available.  Is this the best way or did I miss something? Do you recommend passive Investing?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doing some research on how to start investing for retirement I came across the &lt;a href=""/r/bogleheads""&gt;/r/bogleheads&lt;/a&gt; subreddit. They basically advocate Passive investing as the safest long-term investment strategy. I&amp;#39;m not sure on the Consensus in this subreddit but I firmly believe that a lot of people could benefit from knowing more about passive investing and the benefits associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been a long time subscriber, but haven't really been active in this sub ... mostly because my income was rather insignificant. But I recently started my professional career with a decent income! Yay finally.

One of the things I'm trying to do with my new cash flow is paying back my parents for all the support they provided me through my education. So I've already planned my budget with a portion of it set aside for my parents. 

I should mention at this point that I am employed and living in the US, while my parents are in East Asia.

Personally, I'd love to open up a local (US) checking account in my name and somehow give them the access by mailing them a fee-free debit card or equivalent. If that's at all possible, my plan is to just transfer some amount of money with each pay period so that the money just becomes available to my parents. However, I currently lack the knowledge of being able to pull it off with confidence in knowing that I won't be breaking any rules or laws, and making sure that I'm not setting myself and my parents up for unexpected taxes, terrible fee schedule, or exchange rates.

I understand that there's always an option to just transfer the funds internationally and directly into their accounts, but I'm not a big fan of that idea because I want to ...

 1. Avoid relatively high transfer fees, especially because the amount I'll be transferring will be rather small with each transaction.
 1. Still have the funds accessible by my own family *as well as* my parents. This is because I know (from being their child) that they'll be quite hesitant to use their children's money even if it's being put aside for their own use. I expect them to perhaps treat their relatives or friends out to dinner with the funds I provide every once in a while, but let most of it sit as the emergency stash or to have it go to big-ticket items (e.g. down payments) in the future.

One thought I had was to open up an *additional* Investor Checking account with Charles Schwab (has unlimited ATM fee reimbursement and no foreign transaction fees) in my name and see if I can add my parents as ""authorized users"" or just allow them to use my debit card if that's something the bank is OK with.

I'd love some suggestions and advice on the matter. Thank you all in advance for your help!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello PF!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run a small personal training business and made a post about it on a small business page on Facebook to get exposure and some ideas for acquiring new leads and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I posted that, I received a random email from a guy saying he wanted to buy my services for his daughter and a friend. He only had a credit card, which I thought was a red flag. He kept pushing further, saying he didnt wanna do a consult (which I do for liability purposes) - red flag #2. He just said he got my business email off of &amp;quot;social media&amp;quot; (kind of a red flag #3 - usually people say a definitive social media site). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most damming evidence was that he also stated he was gonna send me my money and that he wanted to send me an extra $1050 for the charter bus that would transfer the girls to and from my gym.

I’ve searched this sub for this phrase and have found super helpful stuff, but I want to just make sure I’m doing this right, and would welcome any insight on it as well!

I worked a job that would get a W2 until July 31 2018. I also have a PRN job that I work approximately 8-10 hours a month that would be W2 as well. I began working my new independent contractor job in the end of June on the side to transition into the new role and have some financial security. I get paid monthly based on how many clients I see for that. 

I’ve been tracking all expenses, mileage, etc so far since June related to this IC job. I do understand that there are quarterly payments to be made, one coming up soon. What I understand is essentially I have to estimate (even though the IC income can fluctuate based on clients). I calculated my best estimate of expected income for this last part of the year.

My main questions-
I’m using the 1040ES, is this correct? 
-I did the first part of calculations (form that says 2018 self employment tax and deduction worksheet for lines 1&amp;9), then onto estimating the larger form that goes from 1-15 is where I am not sure
-How on earth do I estimate deductions until the end of the year? I have some business materials, professional expenses, mileage. I guess I’m just feeling confused how to do this
-And do I have to do anything with my other jobs or can I just forget about those until annual filing rolls around?

Thank you in advance!

She now has $30k in lawyer expenses due in full by December. How does she pay her lawyer?  


Hello PF, this post is regarding a friend.I met her about two years ago. She and her boyfriend had parted ways while pregnant and she moved to our town to be near her sister. Her sister is active duty military and had to move (PCS). Friend started to establish roots and stayed.She gave birth to a girl last year. She did her best trying to make ends meet: worked two jobs with erratic hours at a hospital and as a waitress. This included day shift, night shift, weekends, etc. Of course, it’s traditional daycare isn’t available for nights and weekends, so she found someone in her apartment complex who could watch the baby at those hours. She did not have any child support from the father, who lived in another city. She did not ask friends for any favors and tried to make ends meet on her own.  


The baby was hospitalized and further testing showed evidence of *shaken baby syndrome*. My friend, the mother, states she is innocent. The police have interviewed everyone involved in caring for the baby and it is still an open case. Because CPS is involved, she has to demonstrate that she can provide a stable household: she is restricted on how many hours she can work (no night shifts nor overtime), she can't move again to a more affordable place (currently looking for a roommate). *This is my understanding, but I can ask for clarification.*  


That’s how a lawyer got involved, to go to court to win custody. When the baby’s shaken baby hospitalization occurred, the father was notified and now he wants custody too. I am biased since I hear things second hand from the mother.In December, friend stated that the lawyer wants $30,000 paid in full. She says she is currently on a 0% interest payment plan with the lawyer. I have never worked with a lawyer before; maybe she is currently paying a retaining fee?  


I plan to meet with her this week to **make a budget**. I’ve discussed expenses briefly with her and it does not seem that she has much superfluous spending.She seems responsible, but she does not make much income. She makes approx. $26k a year, or $1100 take home pay every 2 weeks. She donates plasma.  


**Financial history:** low credit score, maybe 550. I'm not sure why her score is so low, maybe delinquent or debt:income ratio? She pays $110/month to a credit agency. $250 car loan, to be paid off in February. I'll ask what the interest rate are on those.  


Right now it seems like she can just make ends meet - but with the new $30k loan, it seems impossible.

**What are her options for needing such a large amount of money?** I'll try to answer any questions if you have them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Friend went to court to obtain custody of a child.

This included day shift, night shift, weekends, etc. Of course, it’s traditional daycare isn’t available for nights and weekends, so she found someone in her apartment complex who could watch the baby at those hours. She did not have any child support from the father, who lived in another city. She did not ask friends for any favors and tried to make ends meet on her own.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baby was hospitalized and further testing showed evidence of &lt;em&gt;shaken baby syndrome&lt;/em&gt;. My friend, the mother, states she is innocent. The police have interviewed everyone involved in caring for the baby and it is still an open case. Because CPS is involved, she has to demonstrate that she can provide a stable household: she is restricted on how many hours she can work (no night shifts nor overtime), she can&amp;#39;t move again to a more affordable place (currently looking for a roommate). &lt;em&gt;This is my understanding, but I can ask for clarification.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how a lawyer got involved, to go to court to win custody. When the baby’s shaken baby hospitalization occurred, the father was notified and now he wants custody too. I am biased since I hear things second hand from the mother.In December, friend stated that the lawyer wants $30,000 paid in full. She says she is currently on a 0% interest payment plan with the lawyer. I have never worked with a lawyer before; maybe she is currently paying a retaining fee?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to meet with her this week to &lt;strong&gt;make a budget&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve discussed expenses briefly with her and it does not seem that she has much superfluous spending.She seems responsible, but she does not make much income. She makes approx. $26k a year, or $1100 take home pay every 2 weeks. She donates plasma.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial history:&lt;/strong&gt; low credit score, maybe 550. I&amp;#39;m not sure why her score is so low, maybe delinquent or debt:income ratio? She pays $110/month to a credit agency. $250 car loan, to be paid off in February. I&amp;#39;ll ask what the interest rate are on those.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now it seems like she can just make ends meet - but with the new $30k loan, it seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are her options for needing such a large amount of money?&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ll try to answer any questions if you have them.&lt;/p&gt;

About seven months ago I moved to west Texas. The first two months electricity bills were circling around 65-85 dollars a month. Starting in June the bill skyrocketed to 409 a month and now for August they're asking 500. Here's the problem:
1) due to work, I travel often
2) I live in a one bedroom apartment totaling 805 SQ/Ft. 
3) the months where the kilowatts tripled and quadrupled (June-August) I was home for a collective total of 2 weeks. 
4) Due to the frequency of travel my payments were in autopay so I didn't know I was spending so much on electricity. 
I really can't keep this up, especially when I have taken careful measures to be responsible in energy use and turning everything off before leaving. The rising costs are eating into other budgets. Are there any resources I can use to find out what's going on? 

Update:

Thanks everyone for the tips and steps to take. I managed to compile the usage history into an album.

I went in, drove it around, and loved it, and so I started to go through the paperwork. This was my first time ever buying a vehicle and I definitely got screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

He gave me a paper with the cost of the vehicle and it said 12,250 dollars. I told him that wasnt right and it was listed for 8600 on the website and he responded, ""The reason it says 12,250 is because of the interest and the fees being added to the listed price"". This made sense as I was taking out a loan for it and put 3000 down. (I think it made sense). So i continued through the paperwork and they had me sign some papers digitally and on of the papers I saw that with interest i was paying 21,000 dollars for this car, so I once again asked him why the price of the car was 12,000 dollars and he told me, ""8600 Dollars is for the walkin cash people. Because you're financing, the bank is going to sell you the car for what it wants to sell it for""

I believed him stupidly, soooo stupidly, I was desperate for a car because mine broke down earlier yesterday and I needed something to get to work. As it turns out, they charged me 4000 dollars more for the vehicle than the listed price, they charged me 2000 dollars for a warranty while telling me it was free. They stuck me with a 23% interest rate with a 650 Credit Score, and said it's because i've never taken a loan out before.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I made the deal regardless of the red flags is because they gave me 1500 dollars for a truck that didn't even work, nor would ever work or sell. They told me that they would hook me up with a 14 week plan, make weekly payments of 90 dollars each for 14 weeks, so that at the end of the 14 weeks I'll be able to refinance for much lower interest rate, and they told me everyone who had done this it worked out for. So I figured I could stick out the 400 dollar a month payments for 3.5 months and then be alright afterwards. But I'm realizing that if they straight up added 4000 dollars to the price of the car, and lied to my face about it, im royally fucked. Is there anythign I can do to get out of this deal, anything please.

EDIT 2: Is it at all possible for me to pay off the complete principal before any interest accrues, or am I stuck paying the interest first?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, yesterday I bought a 2010 Ford Taurus SEL, The vehicle was listed on their website for 8.6 thousand dollars which was affordable for me. I went in, drove it around, and loved it, and so I started to go through the paperwork. This was my first time ever buying a vehicle and I definitely got screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave me a paper with the cost of the vehicle and it said 12,250 dollars. I told him that wasnt right and it was listed for 8600 on the website and he responded, &amp;quot;The reason it says 12,250 is because of the interest and the fees being added to the listed price&amp;quot;. This made sense as I was taking out a loan for it and put 3000 down. (I think it made sense). So i continued through the paperwork and they had me sign some papers digitally and on of the papers I saw that with interest i was paying 21,000 dollars for this car, so I once again asked him why the price of the car was 12,000 dollars and he told me, &amp;quot;8600 Dollars is for the walkin cash people. Because you&amp;#39;re financing, the bank is going to sell you the car for what it wants to sell it for&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Currently I am in college and my parents are helping me out with paying rent and sending me the occasional money to help with utilities/gas/groceries, etc.  After my current lease ends this summer, I plan to find a new place with my roommates. Currently my parents have co-signed my lease and, again, help me with rent. While I extremely appreciate that, they tend to hold that over my head for certain things. When my lease is up, my plan is to be in the financial situation to be able to sign my own lease with no cosign. That way, if worse comes to worse with my family, they have no control over my living situation and cannot end my lease or something of the sort. Here is my current plan; I'm looking for critiques, ideas and suggestions because I know this isn't perfect:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Currently I have no credit. I plan to get a credit card, only use it for buying groceries and gas, and pay it off in full. With no credit, I'm not entirely sure what I should get. I'm looking at the  [Discover Student](https://www.creditcards.com/credit-cards/discover-it-for-students/?catid=18) card. What exactly should I be looking at in a credit card, and what cards would even accept me for having no credit? Also, I have read that it takes 6 months to go from having no credit score to a decent score. Is this true?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Saving money. I make about \~$200 per week. (this winter break/this summer I will work a lot more hours, and hopefully this summer will get a much better paying internship/job). I am putting half of each paycheck into my savings, not touching it until my new lease starts and I need to pay rent (unless my car breaks down or something big). My plan is that if my potential landlord next year turns me down for being young/not having co-sign/not having a good credit score for not having a credit card for that long etc, I can offer to pay quite a few months of rent up front. Currently have a little over $5k saved, so I'm doing well there I think. (rent here typically goes for at most $700 a month)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Eating habits. To save money, I have been trying to cook affordable meals (/r/mealprepsunday inspired). I also carpool with roommates when possible and walk to class to save on gas. Also trying to eat out less/when I eat out, order value meals etc

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a hair stylist with \~$8,000 in debt for hair school.  I am also a student at Portland State University studying graphic and web design.  This is my second full year and I've already taken out an additional \~$8,000 in loans last year for school, and after this school year will be \~$30,000 in debt, with at least 2 more years left to go.  I am not getting outside help from family.  My financial aid package is a joke.  I barely make enough to live when I'm not a full-time student (definitely not enough to save), but according to the government I make \*just\* too much to qualify for any grants. I also spent hours applying for scholarships through my school (and also places like Fastweb) and I did not get a single one.  So I have to take out only loans.  I work as a stylist about 20 hours a week while taking 16 credit hours.  I can't handle working more than that.  I hate hate hate hate hate doing hair, so fucking much.  It's the only thing I am currently skilled to do, however, and it pays better than any other entry-level job I could currently get.

Looking at the amount I currently owe, and what I am expecting to owe at the end (\~50,000), I am just so frustrated.  I hate my job and my career path currently.  I have to get out of it.  I'm so sick of being poor.  Graphic and web design is a direction that I would like to go but the job market is so tough here that I don't think I could get a job without at least a bachelors degree.  The higher education system seems so unfair.  School seems to only be a viable option for the wealthy or people with outside help.

Rant aside, I am just wondering what the opinion is on loans exceeding 50,000 for an undergrad degree?  A quick google search says that average school debt is \~30,000.  I don't know why my debt will be so much higher than that.  (even with subtracting the $8,000 from hair school).  I live very frugally.  I don't have a car. I bike to school instead of paying for the term long bus passes.  I live in Portland, which is really expensive, but my rent is cheap(ish) because I live farther out.  I just don't understand how people make it work.  I know alot of people get help from family, but not everyone gets family help, right?  How do I pursue higher education without ruining my life?

38F, Married RN, 2 small kids. I make more than my husband (me approx $105K/year, him approx $55K).

I owe the following:

$21K in student loan debt at 3.1% interest

$5K in credit card debt at 0% interest

$3K in car loan debt at 3.1% interest

We have a mortgage, but payments are manageable and not too relevant here.

I have $9,000 saved at Ally and have retirement savings and college plans going. With the savings at Ally, I could pay off all my credit card and all my car loan today and roll that money into a student loan payment that would have me debt-free in 25 months. Doing so, I'd still be able to save about $1000/month back at Ally. After the 25 months--given that no major new expenses arise--I'd be able to save $1810 (total) monthly at Ally.

However! Since the loan interest rates are so low, wiping out my emergency savings to pay them off seems irresponsible, especially with kiddos on hand. I'm really, really tempted to just hit the ""pay off"" button.

This doesn't include the separate mutual fund account we have in our kid's name, to which we're contributing monthly, which by itself will be a good chunk of change when they're grown up. Same will be done for the future planned kid. We're hoping our children will use this money constructively in the future - for education, business or other large essential expenses.

At some point, we like to reveal this to our children (at least their own portion of it) so that they can use it fruitfully in their education or career.

But we've seen so many ""rich"" kids getting spoilt, and bad actors coming into their lives, when they know they have lots of money. We don't want that to happen.

We're planning to raise our kids to be money-smart. Any ""work"" they do above the basic household responsibilities, will earn them an ""income"" which they can accumulate and spend on whatever ""stuff"" they want above the basics provided by the family. Hopefully, by the time they are adults, even if they aren't terribly excited about money, they'll at least know how money works in the real world.

Despite having this plan in place, we're really confused and apprehensive about how and when to let the children know that we have and will accumulate a large sum of money?

Of course saving, investing and growing this wealth and not revealing to them at all would be stupid. We're just looking for the right time.

**Do we let them know this plan right from the start?** What if they grow up to be lazy and spoiled knowing this money existed or would exist in future?

**Do we do it when they're 18?** I don't think they'll be smart about large sums of money at that age. But it might allow them to choose a high paying career that requires expensive education.

**Do we do it only when they're 25 - 30?** At this point they would have had a job for a few years and their money management skills will be more visible. But what if they'd have chosen a better field of education at 18, if they knew this money existed? But what if at 18 they saw this money and thought ""okay, I'm gonna goof around and not do anything""?

**Do we do it when we die, through inheritance?** By this time, this money could be completely useless to them except for frivolous spending on expensive cars and stuff. They might already be set in career and switching at this point might be impossible. All of that, unless they're enlightened and use it to build generational wealth and pass it on.

**How do middle class families, that accumulate any significant amount of wealth, for the first time in their family tree, let their children know about it and use it for the betterment of the family tree?**

So he comes, helps out, and we notice I need some brick work done, so he recommends a guy. So this is where the issue starts.

The brick guy comes and checks everything out (remember, I know nothing about this). We see that these bricks are deteriorating and we need to stop moisture from getting behind/ on these bricks (they are ground level with no moisture barrier. 

He tells me what he will have to do: dig all the way down the house where there is damage down to the foundation, sand down the bad bricks, put Quick wall up (concrete paste), wait for that to dry, put primer on, and then put a moisture barrier up. All in all, he said $2,000. Again, seemed reasonable for the work, I say okay. 

Well I spoke to my concrete guy and he ends up excavating all the land around the house away as we decided to do a concrete walkway down the house. I tell the brick guy, he's ecstatic he doesn't have to dig now. So he shows up, sands the brick and puts Quick wall up, and leaves for the day and says he will be back tomorrow to finish as the concrete needs to dry. He was there for about 2 hours with his partner. He also says we don't need to prime anymore, so all he has to do is stick the moisture barrier up. He then asks how I can pay him (I was leaving town for work and was going to leave him a check). He says $1500 is fair. I say okay, and he leaves. 

I think about it and go ($1500...for a few hours work? Hmm) So I call him and tell him since he didn't have to dig and that he isn't priming anymore, should we revisit the price. He tells me he will call me in 20 minutes as he is arriving to his next job. He calls me back and apologizes and says he does believe $1500 is high, and says $1000.

Whatever, I still think it's high, but okay. Well, he calls me a little later and says he can't finish this week as his kid has a soccer tournament and can be there Monday next week. Issue is concrete is getting poured on Tuesday this week, and I cannot wait that long. He apologizes but there is nothing he can do, he even recommended I finish it to not delay the concrete pour. 

So there I am, 7am this morning with Youtube videos up, priming the walls (yes, it DID need the primer), and finished up the job. Took me about 3 hours (alone). So I text him saying I finished the job, and I would like to revisit the price again as it would help me out. He has not responded all day, he has viewed the text message (Read receipts).

Tomorrow is Monday - should I cancel the check? I'm not sure what the next step is, but right now I paid $1000 for 2 hours work of two people. I know this is entirely my fault, but not sure what to do now. 

Any help would be much appreciated. 

EDIT: I gave him the check Saturday morning about 8am, it is now Sunday 1:30 as I cannot sleep due to this. I am not sure how long I have to cancel or if he has deposited the check already.

He then asks how I can pay him (I was leaving town for work and was going to leave him a check). He says $1500 is fair. I say okay, and he leaves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about it and go ($1500...for a few hours work? Hmm) So I call him and tell him since he didn&amp;#39;t have to dig and that he isn&amp;#39;t priming anymore, should we revisit the price. He tells me he will call me in 20 minutes as he is arriving to his next job. He calls me back and apologizes and says he does believe $1500 is high, and says $1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever, I still think it&amp;#39;s high, but okay. Well, he calls me a little later and says he can&amp;#39;t finish this week as his kid has a soccer tournament and can be there Monday next week. Issue is concrete is getting poured on Tuesday this week, and I cannot wait that long. He apologizes but there is nothing he can do, he even recommended I finish it to not delay the concrete pour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there I am, 7am this morning with Youtube videos up, priming the walls (yes, it DID need the primer), and finished up the job. Took me about 3 hours (alone). So I text him saying I finished the job, and I would like to revisit the price again as it would help me out. He has not responded all day, he has viewed the text message (Read receipts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is Monday - should I cancel the check? I&amp;#39;m not sure what the next step is, but right now I paid $1000 for 2 hours work of two people. I know this is entirely my fault, but not sure what to do now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be much appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I gave him the check Saturday morning about 8am, it is now Sunday 1:30 as I cannot sleep due to this. I am not sure how long I have to cancel or if he has deposited the check already. &lt;/p&gt;

B.) Sell our home first and try to immediately buy one without having to rent in between. Not sure if the time of year matters but it sounds difficult since we're literally forced to buy something within weeks of selling.

C.) Buy a home with a contingent offer on selling our home first (considering how competitive the market is for buyers, I doubt any seller would want this kind of offer unless maybe during Winter)

Sorry if this is not the right place to post this.

Anywho, around mid to late May my girlfriend and I are planning to move out. We are both going to a community college right now and she will be finishing up in May, when she is finished that's when we plan to move and are looking to get an apartment together most likely in Richmond, VA because she wants to continue her education there. When we move I will still need another semester or two to finish my degree at CC, I've talked with my adviser and I can most likely finish online.

&amp;#x200B;

We both work she makes about 400-450 bi-weekly and I make around 600-650 at the same rate and both companies we work for will most likely be able to transfer us to locations close by when we move. Combined we only have around 600 saved but once I finish paying for this semester ( I should make my last payment october 4th) I am hoping to start saving much more, about 300 from each paycheck and she is saving around 150-200 with each paycheck. Neither of us have any huge debts. However, I do owe a little under 1,600 from last semester in student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming we will be making roughly the same(a little under 2k/month) can we realistically afford an apartment? What kind of price range should we be looking at and what should we prepare for? Is renters insurance something we should really look into?

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions I'll answer them as best as I can. Thank you all in advance, any help is much appreciated!

A few more abstract concerns remain.

One, we have always had and still have good credit, so what types of things should I expect on the horizon as a family unit with a black mark on our credit/in that post bankruptcy status I may not have considered? Some points more obvious to me include that during the first 2 years specifically after chapter 7, don't anticipate being able to get new credit, be it a credit card or loans, a mortgage, etc. That's actually fine as we fully intend to live within our means from here on out. On the other hand though, what about establishing service with utilities or cable at a new rental? What if we need to move and rent, is it tough to get approved for a lease on a place? Note that we presently rent a house, have flawless rental history and for what it's worth have no assets. I understand that this is a serious undertaking, I'd just prefer not to be blindsided by some negative impact down the road I had not considered.

What is the likelihood that this gets back to my employer? I don't think it would be an issue now, but what if I needed to find a job? As I mentioned, we have had solid credit our whole adult lives so that's never been an issue before; could it be?

Both law firms told us our cars would be exempt from being taken. I drive a 99 Chevy cavalier we own outright, and we make payments on a 2016 crv, and owe something like 21k. There is less than 1k equity in it. Is the bit about these being exempt true?


I understand that it means we can't get credit for a while, again, that's fine, the ability to live within our means free from boneheaded debt payments will be a benefit, so we don't want credit for the foreseeable future anyway. I also understand that it means that our dreams of owning a house are on the back burner for 2 years min... When we emerge on the other side of 2 years, what is the clearest path back to a decent credit score and approval for a decent rate on a mortgage? Again, will want to avoid credit even at that point.

Would it make sense to start repairing our credit score after the 2 years, while paying down the remaining debt and saving for a down payment, getting the best rate we can at the time we're ready to buy, and then refinancing down the road, maybe after our bankruptcy has fallen off?

Along with saving for school and diapers. 

Total monthly expenses come out to around $900. 

The 6 month old formula is covered by wic and her insurance is medicaid which will change about 8 months from now. Her mother and I are together and I provide for everything the baby needs for the most part. 

A couple of months ago i made the decision to finance a car, at the time I had a job that allowed me to do that and still be in the positive at the end of the month. What I didn't do however is make sure that the job was secured to me, unfortunately it was not and i lost the job shortly after finalizing everything for the car and i could no longer back out. Now i am trying to get out from under the payment. 
I owe around $16,000 on it and after pricing it out I'm trying to sell it for $18,000 so I can either get a different car free and clear or buy my moms Subaru which she offered to me, I just had to get a loan for it. My step dad will also be able to work on the Subaru and has offered to do so. 

If I can sell my current car for $18,000 and get the $2,000 I could get a loan at about 8% interest for $14,000 with a down payment of the $2,000. The job I have is allowing me to bring home about $420 per week with a total of $1,680 per month along with a side job on weekends that can bring between $100 and $300 extra per weekend and at the low end bring my total income up to $2,080 a month. I guess my question is should I buy the Subaru and try to pay off the car loan as quickly as possible or get a car that I'm not sure of the reliability of? 


EDIT 1: For those of you saying I was trying to be cool, it wasn't about that at all. I wanted something reliable that would age well, get great gas mileage, and be safe for the baby. If it was about being cool, I would've gotten something more expensive and sportier. I bought a civic, not a mustang. I came for advice, not to be dragged for my lack of knowledge on the subject.

EDIT 2: The Subaru maintenance would be done at home, granted the loan while not a great idea as of now, would make it easier in the future credit wise. 

EDIT 3: With a loan for the Subaru, I would be throwing roughly half of my income at it, meaning it would only take 12-18 months to pay it off. Though I could get something cheap and reliable for now until I have the ability to pay cash for it. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to start I&amp;#39;ll introduce my situation: I&amp;#39;m 19 with a 6 month old baby, I have little to no living expenses, my responsibilities are my car payment, car insurance, phone bill, and cc bill. Along with saving for school and diapers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total monthly expenses come out to around $900. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6 month old formula is covered by wic and her insurance is medicaid which will change about 8 months from now. Her mother and I are together and I provide for everything the baby needs for the most part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago i made the decision to finance a car, at the time I had a job that allowed me to do that and still be in the positive at the end of the month. What I didn&amp;#39;t do however is make sure that the job was secured to me, unfortunately it was not and i lost the job shortly after finalizing everything for the car and i could no longer back out. Now i am trying to get out from under the payment.

Everything else seems like a bit of a wash...taking home more an hour is nice, but losing a year of company match seems a bit much if I'm not making a lot more.


Any insight? Thank you","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in banking, I have an offer at another bank for an extra 2$ an hour, a slightly better position, and more chance to earn bonus&amp;#39; per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

He has been working for a small construction company for the last 5 years and renting the same apartment the whole time. The  mortgage payments for the houses he has been looking at would be about the same as his current rent. Even though his credit score is 720 apparently he doesn’t have enough history to qualify for a 30 yr mortgage.

Aside from rental and utility payments, his only other credit history is as an authorized user on one of our credit cards.  He uses that credit card to buy plane tickets to come home to visit and for occasional other expenses that we explicitly ask him to use the card for. 

Initially our plan was to gift him a 20% down payment ($20K) so that his current savings could go toward renovations.  After his conversations with lenders who are suggesting ARMs and mortgages with balloon payments, we are thinking we want to do more. We could finance the entire mortgage, but are concerned that won’t help his credit history.  We could also co-sign. Our credit ratings would take a bit of a hit (currently at 830 and 850) but our only debt is our own mortgage and we are about 8 years from retirement with a pretty good portfolio so even if he was disabled or something, it wouldn’t break us.

It seems crazy to me that a young person like my son can’t buy a very modest house that will cost him about as much as his current rent. Are we missing something? Are there options for low income home buyers that aren’t really sketchy?  Even though we are fairly comfortable financially maybe we aren’t savvy enough to advise our son here.

An apartment isn't really an option, I want a house with a yard. I don't want roommates, at least for now..

The absolute cheapest houses (1-3bdroom) I can find in my area are about 1.7k/mo, with many being 2k month. Most are 3 bedroom homes that are available, sometimes 2bedrooms will pop up, rarely if ever do 1 bedroom homes pop up.

My income is variable, but the lowest I will get in a year is about 70000 if I am unlucky, this year I'm set to be at about 74-78k. I have the potential to be at 100,000 (hasn't happened yet, but it can if I get lucky). I think most years will be right around 80ish though.

2k seems to be right around 1/3rd of my gross income.. but sheesh thats a lot. Also that doesn't include utilities/internet, and I'll have to buy furniture and stuff, but I can mostly go second hand and take my time getting things when the price is right.

I texted her back, telling her I would be in the city she was claiming to live next week and that we could exchange the dress and cash in person. Of course, I never heard back (this was a week ago).

1. Should I roll the two prior employer Roth 401K's into my Roth IRA? 
   1. If so, is Vanguard or Schwab the preferred player? Feel like I need to pick one and run with it.
2. What should I invest the Roth IRA in? Was thinking something along the lines of the Core Four portfolio with an 80/20 contribution (the funds of which are TBD depending on the brokerage used).

I've saved up about $7500 in a car fund over the past several months. In the mean time my girlfriend and I have been sharing her car and found that it's actually working relatively well, so I'm considering putting off the purchase and using the car fund to knock out what's left of my student loan. I think I'm just overanalyzing and struggling to pull the trigger.

The loan was a $22k principle, 10 year fixed 5%, current balance \~$8300. This is my only debt.

I also have an emergency fund at about $12,000, which is \~8 months of essential expenses. I currently have \~$2k per month ""extra"" income (currently split between overpaying the loan, Roth IRA, and car fund).

My long-term goals are a modest engagement ring (probably 2020) and then a wedding (likely 2021), and eventually a home further down the road. For now, being debt free and maxing out my IRA would feel amazing.

Am I overlooking anything here? I know I might need a car if I took another job with a longer commute, but there's some transit infrastructure here and my credit is excellent (825+) so I could get a decent rate on a loan if necessary. If we separated I would likely relocate back to my home city where I wouldn't need a vehicle. Her car is in good shape and we're likely moving in 2020 to a large city where we wouldn't want to have two cars. Is there anything else to consider? Could the money be put to better use elsewhere?

Hello! I'm a 28 year old looking for advice on the smartest thing to do with my stocks which have been awarded to me over the last six years working at Amazon. Unlike most of my coworkers, I have never sold any shares except for the automatic ""sell to cover"" feature offered by the stock account for tax purposes. I originally started as a low level, low pay employee, earning a few yearly shares. I've taken a few promotions since then which have awarded me additional shares. At this time, I have 80 shares in my stock account with 2/3 of them being vested and available for sale right now. The rest will vest soon. 

Six years ago when I first started receiving shares, they were only worth ~$250 apiece. Today these shares are worth ~$1950 apiece. Obviously I'm super happy that my shares have exploded in value but I'm getting some anxiety about what the most responsible move should be from here. I do not particularly need the funds right now and I have a comfortable amount in savings and 401k. My only debt is about $40,000 remaining on a mortgage. I just want to accrue wealth safely.

As it is right now, leaving them untouched has been incredibly lucrative for me. I'm just worried about leaving all my eggs in one basket in the event that the shares suddenly start to decline for any reason. Should I sell all now? Some now? Leave them all alone? Reinvest in other areas? I'm open to all advice here. I'm standing by ready to answer any specific questions if it will help give the best recommendation. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not very well versed in these matters, so I'm wondering if there's some reason why that wouldn't work for me or not even be a possible option.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I owe 10.7k. The KBB value is 6.6k-7.7k (Nissan Versa) and my rate is 12.17%. I have 5k to spend.

There's a huge 20k initial fee, as well as the ~$70 monthly maintenance fees. The initial payment accrues interest at 15% which they know is ungodly, but they're planning on paying that off very quickly, so aren't concerned about the interest rate.

I have two younger siblings, both currently in college. In the past two years they both applied for and were given Discover IT cards. They currently have credit scores around 750 and have credit lines of 1350 and 1750. 

I'm 24, have graduated college, have a job that pays about 50k a year, have no debt, have made all of my payments on time, and have savings of over 50K (most of it in a ROTH IRA). At the time I had no credit and was told, this was the reason I wasn't accepted (my siblings also had no credit at the time).

Also tried to apply for another similar card and was denied. With 2 credit inquiries I started to get scared and decided to just get a low tier Capital One card that granted me a credit line of $300. I've had this card for about 8 months now. My credit line is now a whopping $400 and my score is sitting at 672. I'm not stressed for money or anything but am just confused about why I am having so much trouble getting up to normal levels of credit.

I'd appreciate any advice about why this is the case and what my next steps should be. Thanks!

First some background.   About 4 years ago I went through a divorce and started deal with a legal issuing that unfortunately is still ongoing.  I have always had issues with anxiety and depression, but was diagnosed during this time with more serious mental health issues that at times manifest with uncontrolled impulses at times when I'm off my meds.   

During the legal and health issues, I ended up racking up a large amount of debt.  To make matters worse, because of my depression, I missed some payments during this time.   The results of this was my credit crashing.   The lease of my car was up in August of 17, so I went to get another lease during a high depression time alone (bad mistake), and made a bad decision.  End result is I have a 72 month high interest loan that is $674 a month.  

For the last 1.5 years I have been surviving because I get a rather sizable loan that I have managed to stretch out for the year to pay for any issues that come up or any overages that I have.   At the beginning of this year My compulsion reached a really bad point at the same time I met a woman online and the same time I got tis years bonus.  Also, my 18 yo daughter had a baby and the father ended up in jail.   Basically I ended up spending all the loan instead of putting it into savings like I had.   

So for the last 4 months I have been struggling to pay bills, skipping payments,  and I knew I had to do something.  So I finally forced myself to sit down and calculate all my expenses and what I found was a shock of cold water in the face.   I make what I consider good money, and after calculating all my expenses, I dont have enough to cover them.   Here is a summary of what I found:

Rent 1600 - I am starting to look for a new place.  My lease is up at the end of October.  I have to give 60 day notice so I may have to go month to month for a month.  I'm concerned about my credit and the legal issue if they run a background check, but I have no conviction so I hope that helps.

300 - Storage Unit.   most of the things in here I can sell or get rid of.  I have 5 leather recliners I had from when I had a house before the divorce that I need to sell as well as a bed.   The only thing in the storage unit that I want to keep is a china cabinet that was my grandmothers.  I'm not even sure that I want to keep this at this point.   I also have a bunch of collectibles that I need to sell fro when I was running an Amazon business before the divorce that I have been too depressed to do anything with.  I have two months behind on this which is also preventing me from getting into it to do anything with all the items.

Credit Card debt - Minimum Payments $900-1000 a month.  Total debt ~25000 7 cards all over 50% the bigs ones maxed out ($11,000, $7,000 and $4,000).  The others are mostly under $1,000.    

$267 - I am currently paying my daughters insurance.  Se lives in Missouri  and I am in Texas.  She is basically a single mom with a newborn so I've been helping her.  I know that I need to tell her she has to take some of this on. 

275 - phone bill.  This is something is so high cause my daughter is on my plan and she has a phone. I also have an ipad.   I am going to call and cancel the ipad and this is also something she needs to help with.  I may also look at switching provides.  Its at&amp;t and I know this is way to high (And I even have a 30% discount).

100 - Cable I just cancelled this.   I have to keep Internet for work.

1100 - child support

~375 a month in medical expenses (Doctors/Prescriptions/etc)

120 fuel

120 Tolls

200 Auto Insurance

270 Student Loans

240 Electricity



So I listed some of the things I'm doing above.  I have already cancelled many of the perks that I had.  Subscriptions and other ""perks"" I'd been using.  Streamlining to only necessities.   I am stuck on the car.  I know I need to get rid of it, but I know with my credit (632 ) it will be hard.  One thing I have considered is trying to lease a call that is significantly cheaper.  I am upside down by $10000.  I may not be able to get the payment cheaper but at least I can get out of it sooner.  Also the car I'm looking at is electric so it will save on gas.   I am open to other thoughts.   

I have also considered bankruptcy, but I'm not sure I'm to that point yet.  Finally the other option is to enter into a DMP.  I did this about 10 years ago after another divorce, and I did really good on it.  COmpleted it a year early even.   I realize this probably won't help reducing the payments, but it will add structure, and this is also what I need more than anything right now.  THe budget help with this, and it closes all the credit cards, which is also what I think I need.   Anyway, I just wanted to throw this out because A) it helps me organize my thoughts, and B) to see if there is anything else anyone can advise on or change that maybe I'm not seeing.  I am really feeling over my head, and with the other anxiety and depression not controlling this right now just adds to it.  Thanks,

Its no question I am moving across the country. The real question is when. Should I do it as soon as possible and get out of this toxic environment or tough it out for even longer just to save money? Honestly the latter seems impossible right now because literally every day I feel its getting worse. 

I've researched some numbers of the possibility of moving out as soon as possible. Moving to Portland, Oregon and getting a dowtown studio would be anywhere from $1200-$1800 rent. Average pay as a starting OT would be around $70,000-$80,000 starting. I feel like I can make it with the amount of savings I have assuming I can get a decent job right away.

Would appreciate any help or insight at all! I recently graduated from a top 10 MBA program in the US and now working in tech in the SF area. While my salary has drastically increased, so has my debt burden -- I didn't receive any sort of scholarship, and wasn't able to pay anything out of pocket (I was a teacher before so didn't exactly have a nest egg). Right now, I'm looking at about $215K in debt....which has me worried a bit.

My current base salary of 125K leaves me about 5700 a month post taxes, pre-tax benefits, health insurance, etc. My rent is fairly doable, at 1400. My current gov't loan repayment plan has me paying \~2400 a month. So, in total, I have less than 2000 a month for food, savings towards a house, entertainment, etc. I'm single so it's doable, but not ideal. My company also doesn't have a formal bonus structure, so I can't bank on any windfalls in the next couple of years.

Another unfortunate wrinkle is that my credit score is not great -- I have racked up some credit card debt (used my signing to pay it down), and in an earlier, way less mature life, I missed some student loan payments that has my credit score hovering around 700. I bring this up because so far, I have been unable to find a company that is willing to refinance my loans. So, my questions are as follows:

1. Currently, the government offers a graduated payment plan, which offers the student lower monthly payments for the first couple of years, and ""graduates"" to higher payments towards the end of the loan term. I'm considering this so I can build up some savings (remember I have none), to start investing, and to have a steadier cashflow in the short term. Obviously, I may end up paying more interest in the long-term. My thinking is that I can build my credit and pay less in the short term, and bank on being able to refinance my loans before my loans ""graduate"" to the higher monthly payments. Does that make sense?

2) Do my two missed payments of undergrad loans (I know, I should've just set up autopay...I was so young and dumb!) automatically preclude me from any sort of refinancing in the future?

I know this was a long post, so thanks in advance for any tips :) Happy to provide more color as well if needed.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently not financially able to fix the transmission. It would cost around 2k-2.5k to fix and the car is only worth that.


So, I'm in the market for a new car. I have never financed anything before. Back in May I got my first secured credit card and now 5 months later with no issues I have a credit score of 617. (This was only shown on TransUnion's Credit report monitoring BS that I unknowingly signed up for. Experian which is the monitoring that I prefer and pay for doesn't show a score.) My bank doesn't see a score either.

I've spoken with my bank and he said if my car dies tomorrow I can come in and we might be able to work out a loan but it's going to be about 10% interest. He said highs of 6% when my score hits 640 or higher. I assume since this past Wednesday was the start of my 5th cycle that by the 6th I should have above a 640. Could be wrong though. Anyway, I've pretty much narrowed my price down to $15,500. With the said 10% for 6 years that would get my payment around $287 a month. Though that means paying like $5,000 in interest.

Now my employer has their own Credit Union which I have applied for and will hear back from tomorrow. They take my work history and my credit into account from what I've been told. I will be seeing what they might be able to offer me. So that is a possibility for a better APR.

So.. I'm curious as to what you guys think is the best idea here. I've found the car I want, Hyundai Elantra '17-'19. I've found one for $15,000. I don't need a vehicle yet, but I can only limp the transmission so far. I would like to wait for my credit score to get better. Hell, I would have rather not had to buy a new car. Unfortunately, that's how life goes. I'm on my own financially. I've worked out the extra cost and I can make it work. I cannot get a co-signor or anything like that.

During the third year, life happened and we got lax with inputting transactions. Reconciling from bank statements became a chore and we lost the passion for budgeting. 

For the past 18 months we’ve freewheeled it and honestly, it’s not gone well. I’ve got a more steady income coming in now and want to take back control and pay down some debt, so we’re ready to get back to budgeting. 

One of our biggest issues with YNAB has been reliably logging our transactions and I’m keen to avoid this step where possible. 

Recently I have seen that an acquaintance of ours started using PocketSmith so I have been giving it a look. It has automatic transaction imports for our UK bank accounts and can forecast ahead 10 years on the Premium subscription. Both of these tools appeal to me over and above YNAB. 

However, having come from using YNAB and the “give every dollar a job” mantra, I have been getting a little confused with how PocketSmith addresses budgeting and scenarios. I am driven by goals and have previously used YNAB alongside unbury.me to help me visualise debt paydown. It seems that PocketSmith encompasses this functionality, and more, but I’m struggling to make a smooth move across. 

Does anybody have experience using PocketSmith and particularly migrating from YNAB? It’s not so much migrating the data but understanding how they handle budgeting differently including setting goals for items such as auto maintenance and holidays. 

I’d also welcome recommendations of other budgeting tools. I have read the sidebar and seen many apps discussed but there’s nothing that mentions PocketSmith. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I started using YNAB religiously around 4 years ago and for the first couple of years it was great and we saw a huge improvement in our finances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the third year, life happened and we got lax with inputting transactions. Reconciling from bank statements became a chore and we lost the passion for budgeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 18 months we’ve freewheeled it and honestly, it’s not gone well. I’ve got a more steady income coming in now and want to take back control and pay down some debt, so we’re ready to get back to budgeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest issues with YNAB has been reliably logging our transactions and I’m keen to avoid this step where possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have seen that an acquaintance of ours started using PocketSmith so I have been giving it a look. It has automatic transaction imports for our UK bank accounts and can forecast ahead 10 years on the Premium subscription. Both of these tools appeal to me over and above YNAB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, having come from using YNAB and the “give every dollar a job” mantra, I have been getting a little confused with how PocketSmith addresses budgeting and scenarios. I am driven by goals and have previously used YNAB alongside unbury.me to help me visualise debt paydown. It seems that PocketSmith encompasses this functionality, and more, but I’m struggling to make a smooth move across. &lt;/p&gt;

Recently I got my act together and just starting to manage it. I'm just going to describe the situation and looking for your general comments and feedback. My parents never had any money to manage and still don't, so I can't really ask them.

The country is Hong Kong and all my savings are in HKD, but for your convenience I converted that to USD. 

- Income: 3300 USD after tax
- Monthly expenses: about 2000 USD, including 550 USD rent, 1000 USD food, eating out, daily expenses and entertainment, and 500 USD for unexpected expenses like phone repair, sending money to parents etc. 

I don't have any property but also no debt, just finished paying up the credit card.

I'm paying for the cheapest medical insurance (35 USD/month) that has [reasonably large limits](https://www.hangseng.com/content/dam/hase/config/bde/pws/Insurance/pdfs/en_HK/essential.pdf) and 100% cover, but covers only illnesses that require a hospital stay (no private doctors or clinics). I guess it's pretty cheap compared to North America but it does seem to fully cover surgeries and serious illness, even about half of any possible cancer treatment.

I accumulated 25,000 USD in my government-mandated retirement savings. It is non-withdrawable but the funds allocation can be changed. Right now I set it to 30% US stocks fund, 30% global stocks fund, 20% Hong Kong index tracking fund, 20% Asian stocks fund. 

I don't have any other savings (my bank account now is 3000 USD mostly left from the last salary) but I just received a one-time windfall of 22,000 USD and I'm thinking how to use it.

Out of that, 2500 USD is already placed into ""3140.HK"", Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index ETF. My rough plan for the remaining money is this: 

- 700 USD for a small vacation
- 4000 USD in a time deposit that renews every 7 days, which means I can withdraw it any time within a maximum of 7 days if I need it for emergency. That's my planned emergency fund. The interest rate is 0.21% and it's flat regardless of whether it is a 7 days, 14 days or a 1 year deposit.
- 2500 USD in Bitcoin or Ethereum
- 3000 USD each in Vanguard ETFs [""2805.HK"", ""3085.HK"", ""3101.HK"" and ""3140.HK""](https://www.vanguard.com.hk/portal/mvc/investments/all-products) - Asia, Asia High Yield, Developed Europe and S&amp;P 500.

This money is intended for long-term savings and no plans to withdraw it within the next 10 years.

Also, me and my partner are planning to open a joint account and start contributing 650 USD per month each towards a downpayment for an apartment, which after 6 years of savings should be enough for a 10-15% downpayment. For this money I plan to put it into some sort of bond funds because I am thinking there's a high chance of a stock market crash within the next 6 years. 

Partner is debt-free, 2300 USD income and has about 25,000 USD in cash savings, has life insurance and a very good medical plan.

The #s:

$80k my annual salary (take home is $5600/month)

$40k wife's annual salary (take home is $3100 10 months a year)

$1900 per month rent from house
$60k in student debt (her...)

$18k in personal loan @ 11% (used to consolidate debt and buy 2 older cars)

$3k in emergency fund


$7500 a month in living expenses includes:

$1275 mortgage on rental house

$490 car lease (ends in Jan., was an awful decision)

$400 personal loan payment

$200 IBR student loan payment

$3000 on credit card from moving expenses


We are currently renting for $850 a month and can stay here as long as we want.  Our goal is to minimize expenses as much as possible, get the lease turned in (early if we can, even if it doesn't change the remaining payments, it'll drop our car insurance from $70 to $40 monthly).  We are much smarter about other expenses so might be able to cut a few hundred, but we don't want to count on that.  At this time we can live on my salary + rent alone and we intend to do so.  We currently put everything we can on credit cards and pay them off weekly (we use the points for travel and vacations.  It also really simplifies bill paying).  Current monthly savings plan totals $3100 a month the months that the wife gets paid:


$600 rent profit, saved to cover expenses/taxes/etc.

$500 wife's 10 month salary differential

$1000 emergency fund

$500 travel/fun fund

$500 extra personal loan payment to principle

Goals:

* Stay renting the condo and living within means for next 24-32 months, saving in line with the savings plan.  Once VW is turned in, the $490 will go toward personal loan principle each month

* Once the house has been rented for 2 - 2.5 years, put on the market to sell (depending on market conditions, however the neighborhood is in demand even in recessions).  Current market says the house is worth about $350k, we have $225k left on loan @ 3.25%

* Buy house where we live now, with a big ol' downpayment (15y loan, maybe?), but in an amount that allows us to still live solely off of my salary


Concerns:

Taxes:

* Is it true that you have to live in house for past 2 of 5 years to not incur tax on profit from sale?  That is why we figure we'll look to sell after renting for 2 or so years

* We are likely going to file married filing separately so that we can keep her IBR payment to a minimum.  If we don't, it will likely jump $400 a month.  The plan is for her to seek PSLF after 10 years of teaching.  I know there is risk involved in this; however, pretty sure the savings will be worth the risk.  Even at $600 a month in payments, we are unlikely to effect the principle very much.  Loans are $30k @ 2.8% and 30K @ 6.8%.  Thoughts?

* I've adjust our withholdings to account for her income and also the rental income.  I know that I can write off repairs, rental expenses, and the mortgage payment as business costs, correct?


Savings:

* At what point do we have a good enough emergency fund?  I've read everything from 3 months of your most basic living expenses (about $10,500 for us, excluding the rental mortgage) to 6 months of everything (about $45,000).  I work for the Army so my income is very steady, no risk of layoff, etc. The worst that could happen at this point in my career is that I get too injured to continue service, and the medical boards take 12-15 months to separate, so there would be plenty of warning and prep time, and I would be separated with a pension, full medical, etc.

* I'm pretty dependent on my pension, pretty much put all my eggs in that basket.  The wife will have a state pension if she keeps this job, and she's pretty sure she will continue working for the state in one way or another for 20 years when she can retire at 60 with a pension.  How much should we be saving for retirement, since we both are pension-based which is rare these days?


We had been struggling for a decade, since kids are expensive little rat-finks and also the wife and I just pulled our financial heads out of our butts in the last two years and got it to where we had a small emergency fund ($1000) and were living only off my salary, so we could use her part-time work to pay off debt.  We figured up our expenses 2 years ago to find out that we were spending $1100 a month more than we brought in.  A huge eye opener.


Thanks in advance for the advice, help, extra set of eyes, and constructive criticism.  It is important to me to not screw this up.  My wife and I both grew up poor.  My parents left me nothing, they squandered any inheritance they received.  Hers might leave her a little; but they aren't well off.  I don't want that for my kids.

    Sling: 25$ a month
    Nelnet Student Loan: 405$ a month 6%, $40,600 left
    Navient: 122$ a month, Mom payed another 185$ for me, %7-11, around $28,500 left
    
I have other bills like other streaming services, but those I can cut (sirriusXM, CrunchyRoll, Netflix)

As far as what I need to pay on my Moms side

    Mortgage: 220$
    Lot Rent:  317$
    Loan for Home improvment: $297, not sure how much is left if i were to guess ~$15,000 however i dont know the interest

This leads down to my summary 

If I dont pay for student loans, My bills +hers will be around $1900 a month. 

I'm an ITT Graduate and I know some people had their loans forgiven due to their downfall so im not sure if that could be an option to reduce some of my debt

So far if I tally my debt I have around $82,000 combined and my moms is another, $25,000 for the home and home improvement loans

This covers known expenses however I also will have unknown expenses

Funeral, she wished to be cremated which is $3,000 and we would hold the funeral at church. She has $1,000 in life through her bank and another policy she just got a few months ago so we do not know if that one will take effect or how much its worth. (we should find out soon)

I might be able to get a roommate to help with bills as the Home is big enough for multiple people.

Lastly I also have about $1,000 in medical bills and co-pays that are not payed, but I am least worried about these as all the providers are usually good on not forcing the lack of payments.

NOTE: For my car, even if it wasn't totaled the vehicle value is a few thousand less than the remaining loan, so selling it is a no go as I would need to pay a few thousand to get the title released. Might not be an issue now but past advice this was the biggest thing noted. I also have tried for a lower interest rate loan but have been denied do to past non payments of student loans

Any advice here would be appreciated, 

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im 34yo, I live with my mom (no dad) and we share bills as it reduced my cost of living allowing me to pay for my Student Loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been a Cluster as I was in an accident on Tuesday which from the damage, although car is drive-able it will probably be totaled by insurance (other driver at fault their insurance will be covering everything)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after this my mom&amp;#39;s condition went fast (has liver cancer, was being treated but now we only will probably have a few days left with her)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this leaves me with only a few days to get things in order so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1st and foremost, I would like to stay living where I am right now, we have a Mobile Home that is mostly payed for and after all bills are included it is about the same as an apartment around where i live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, this is how my my financials Look&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make around $2200 a month doing 40hrs a week, currently have no savings and $230 in the bank for bills/food before my next paycheck ($1100 every two weeks, next payday is 9/19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bills that I Need to Pay    
Electric+Water: ~200$ a month in summer, ~130$ in Winter    
Gas: 5$ in Summer 50$ in Winter based on use    
Car Loan: 422$ a month 24% and about $10,000 left    
Car Insurance: 130$ a month, at minimal full coverage    
Care Credit: 35$ a month, 24% at $1,000 left to pay

We want to begin ""merging"" our finances. This is mostly so that we don't have to calculate who's paying for what, who owes who money, etc.

We just moved to Taiwan, working the same job with the same company at the same office with the same hours. I make about 5% more than her because I have additional certification, but our incomes, workloads, and responsibilities are otherwise nearly identical. 

Our plan is to open a joint bank account for paying bills, groceries, and activities/ meals we share. We would each keep our personal savings account from before. We would each take out about 20% of our paycheck each month in cash for our own personal spending/ fun, and add any of that that we still have at the end of the month to our individual savings accounts.

She would also keep her student debt. I do not have any debt. I plan on helping her pay off her higher interest loans, but she considers the loans her problems, and doesn't want me to pay more than 10%, which is about as much as I feel like I should contribute for now.

We've talked about this a good bit, and we think it makes sense. I'm of the opinion that we should each take out the same dollar amount at the beginning of each month, and ignore the slight amount I make more than her. She feels that I should take that money for myself, and that we should instead contribute equally to the joint account. We'll continue to hash that idea out, but any thoughts would be appreciated.

As far as we can tell, we have pretty similar spending habits. We're both a tad on the frugal side, but neither of us commonly preoccupy ourselves with thoughts of saving. We've never had a fight about money.

Does our plan make sense? Does anyone have any tips for us? Thank you!

She feels that I should take that money for myself, and that we should instead contribute equally to the joint account. We&amp;#39;ll continue to hash that idea out, but any thoughts would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as we can tell, we have pretty similar spending habits. We&amp;#39;re both a tad on the frugal side, but neither of us commonly preoccupy ourselves with thoughts of saving. We&amp;#39;ve never had a fight about money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does our plan make sense? Does anyone have any tips for us? Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: as a first step towards merging our finances, we want to open a joint bank account, but keep some of our finances separate. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

My step-father recently decided to move out of the house and the state, leaving the option to sell/rent on the table.

Up until only recently, we had come to an agreement that I was going to buy out both of my sisters shares, by method of payments and one sister after the other.

I have invested about $15k over the last year into the house, fixing various issues, renovating and updating the property.  I have secured a long term tenant, who’s first payment will be due this coming week.  After taking out expenses I’ve put into the house for repairs and maintenance, minus the existing mortgage... our individual shares comes out to less than $20,000 each to buy them out.

For reasons I’m not completely in agreement with, they have both reneged on our previous buyout agreement and are demanding full payment now or threat of taking the issue to court.  

My primary means of income is Service Industry, and my Secondary source of income is a small business which the income is not entirely reported.  Because of my low reported income, I think qualifying for a Home Equity Loan May be difficult, as my proof of income may not be sufficient.

I have a 800 credit score, through all of my various credit cards I have at least 72k in “available credit”.  Putting 40k in debt onto credit cards would likely cripple me though and is out of the question.

What other means of obtaining a roughly 40k loan that can be paid off over a period of at least 5, but preferably 10 years might I be able to secure?

I'm a little bit confused with my eyecare insurance through Eyemed.

Exams: 20$ flat

Eyemed covers 180$ of the frame and 20% discount after that.

For the lenses it is free up to 50$ and after that 15$ Co pay for for anti reflective etc.

I went to Pearla Vision which is in network provider and the frames I use now are priced for 465$ (when I Google I can find the same frame for around 200$ from frames direct etc)

I priced this frame with my lenses (+1.5) and out of pocket payment after insurance was around 320$ and it looks like a big ripoff.

I'm new in US and a bit confused. I can just buy the frames and lenses for 300$ online it will be cheaper than insurance. Out of network coverage is 50$

I earn about $130k/year + bonus.  (41) earns about $110k + bonus - she is losing her job this Friday though (1 year severance).  We purchased a house last year, so we do not need to save for a down payment.  I own my car outright, but it's piece of shit, and my wife has a lease for another 3 or 4 years.  No other outstanding debt, we pay our credit cards every month, and we have no student loans outstanding.   Aside from this money in my checking and savings, I have the following: 

- current 401k: $300k (I contribute 10%, no employer match, but they pay into a pension for me)
- 401k from previous company $125k
- pension from current company: $3,378.08 accrued benefit (whatever that means)
- I don't have the exact numbers on my wife's retirement plans, but I will guess she's got about $165k in her 401k, plus a pension with about $150k in it.  (She contributes 10% to her 401k)


So I feel like we are in a good position so far on our retirement planning.  I do not have a Roth IRA, and I did not understand the real benefit of having one until just today when I read another post on here that had a lot of great replies and information from people.  So I will plan on moving forward with trying to open a Roth IRA this year and max that out at $5,500 (assuming I am eligible to do it, I tried to determine that online and it was too confusing to understand).  


What I want is for this money to be invested so that it can hopefully grow over the next 10-15 years, firstly to put toward college for the kids. Then over the course of the 15 or so years after that, whatever is left can grow for retirement.  


I do not want to be ""hands on"" with it, I want to look at my statement every quarter and hopefully see some good growth. I am basically looking for something similar to my 401k accounts.  I can park the money, choose some kind of moderate or aggressive model and then hopefully see some decent returns.  


Along with any suggestions or opinions on that, should I park all of the money in one place?  Or should I spread it between at least 2 different places (or more)?  (meaning, for example, opening an ""aggressive"" investment with Fidelity, and then a ""moderate"" investment with Schwab or whoever...)


Let's say I would use $500-$550k for investment purposes, and then the other $100-$150k will stay in checking/savings as an emergency fund.  Our expenses at the moment are somewhat high and will remain so for another couple of years until my daughter gets to kindergarten, so the more available cash, the more comfortable I would be.

So I guess now I&amp;#39;m just wondering if there are many 35 year olds out there on a similar salary, and if so, how&amp;#39;s it looking for you guys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to update some things from the original post but below is the past year of my finances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salary is in EUR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only began contributing to a pension 13 months ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I plan to rent for the foreseeable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total savings at 19.5k.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Total&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Take home pay (Gross 35k)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26,457&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pension contribution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,938&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Company contribution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,794&lt;/td&gt;

New to personal finance and trying to save some money early-ish (24y/o).

I'm still a student (albeit econ so I should know something about this stuff, right?) and I'm looking at Roth IRAs and it seems like a lot of people here recommend Vanguard, especially for their target funds. I've also been looking on Nerdwallet which is pretty easy to understand, but I can't seem to understand why they rate Vanguard as considerably lower than other options. Especially when other funds this subreddit recommends like Wealthfront and Betterment ARE highly rated on NW.

Here's the link : [https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/the-best-roth-ira-account-providers/?trk=nw\_gn2\_4.0](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/the-best-roth-ira-account-providers/?trk=nw_gn2_4.0)

Some random thoughts:

* I don't know much about trading/investing so I'm nervous about the ""do-it-yourself"" funds, but I am willing to learn.
* I've been using Ally for years and love them, so naturally Ally invest sounds cool, but I'm turned off by their higher fees for lower volume traders.
* [And it seems like (for tax redundancy reasons?) this subreddit advises against robo-investors for a Roth IRA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/854e76/letting_a_roboadvisorwealthfront_handle_your_roth/)
* Charles Schwab seems like a very established name in the business, and I like how they offer regular banking services too, so that option also looks appealing.
* I can make most minimum deposit requirements (if they're under $3k).
* Sorry, this started off as honest curiosity as to the whole vanguard nerdwallet thing, hoping to uncover any opinions this subreddit has about Nerdwallet. But now I think it's turned into a ""recommend me a Roth IRA"" post.

Another option would be to sell the stocks and get invested in some low index funds through Vanguard. We are already currently maxing out retirement options (401K employee match, and two Roth IRAs). My one other concern is that we are near the cut-off for contributing to a ROTH, and also started making rental income this year, so do not want to push us over the edge by selling any stocks and not be able to contribute to our ROTHs this year. I was also struggling to find a good calculator to figure out our MAGI this year, as we had several changes from last year (raise, new job, child on the way, new rental income).

I am living with my folks, but I am hoping to move out as soon as I land a full-time for personal reasons (they're hoarders and a 2-hour commute each way is painful). I have sporadic spend and expenses, so I'll say a maximum of about $300 per month.

I built a budgeting model through my next few years based on /r/personalfinance sidebar and other resources, but obviously, there is a lot of variables I need to account for once my folks stop paying for eats, room, &amp; board. Let me know and I can drop a link to my budget plan.

I am not too sure how I should handle this sudden monetary gift. My friends recommended a lot of choices (e.g. mutual funds, ETFs, weed stocks, higher rate savings at a credit union, blackjack and hookers). Would appreciate advice on this money and the rest of my situation. Thanks.

I am living in France with a British bank account. I get a fixed amount of money into that account every month in GDP. To spend it there's always a massive conversion charge.

Can someone recommend an international bank or French/European bank service that doesn't charge so much?

Bare in mind the following:

I have no proof of employment in France, only by a UK company

I am not studying/have no student card

My current bank does not do international accounts

It's also relatively important for me that the bank I use has decent ethical standing. As in it is relatively young and does not get up to sneaky bank stuff that ends up devastating lives worldwide. Basically a bank with a strict green/ethical agenda. I know that's a big ask. But if someone knows of one that also handles GDP to Euro transfers it would be really great.

I come from a sales background and have an absolute passion and love for sales, business, entrepreneurship and have had several ventures of varying success.

 My first year in real estate I had something to prove and earned a GCI of $176,000.  Unfortunately I was also 21 years old and wasted most of the money I earned (I watched too much wolf of Wall Street if you know what I mean) and ended up with a large tax bill approximately $30,000.  I love real estate but I have found it so incredibly difficult to work consistently as I have no boss and no one to reliably hold me accountable. I have worked on a team and it didn’t work for me. 

My situation now is figuring out what to do.  I feel like I’m missing the skills and experience earned at a 9-5 with consistent work and paycheck. It’s stressful and hard to budget when I have no idea when I’m going to be paid next and my pay checks can be taken away at the last minute by others mistakes. I had severe depression and couldn’t even get out of bed because I went from on top of the world to borrowing money from my parents. I made a rebound this year, paid down 20k in debt and have found a passion working for developers and have closed over $5 million this year and am selling a $18m dollar apartment building which could net me around $100,000 commission (co-listing with another broker). 

I love teaching kids, volunteering to coach soccer has been amazing for my mental health. With the help of Jordan Peterson I escaped the depression.

I have extremely strong negotiation and sales skills with a keen business sense, I’ve been offered positions at other companies and I haven’t taken them as I am somewhat afraid of “giving up” on real estate as I know many real estate agents who make $250k a year easily and I just somehow can’t make myself sit down and do the work needed every day.  

Do I stick it out with real estate? Do I look for a job that allows me to do real estate on the side? I could likely take up an offer to work in business development at a venture capital firm or work as a real estate development relationship manager for a main bank.. but I know that the same effort put directly into real estate would have higher returns.

I recently turned 18 and am looking to apply for a credit card to get started on increasing my credit score. I am a freshman in college, and am lucky enough that my parents are basically paying for everything. 

&amp;nbsp;

From my understanding, getting a CC early on is good even if you only use it a couple times per month for credit purpose. I already have a debit card with Wells Fargo and BOA but those are joint accounts (I was under 18 when those were opened). I also have a Chase Ink CC that my parents gave me a couple years ago, but that account is under my parents so I'm pretty sure it doesn't do anything for my score.

&amp;nbsp;

At this time, I have no income and no bills I have to pay. What are some cards I should apply for (that would actually approve me). APR/Interest isn't an issue as my parents have never had CC debt in their entire life and have stressed the importance of that to me.

First job I had out of uni, 4 years in, calling it over at this point. Ready for something new.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm located in the US. I've got 80k in savings, another 20k spread out over crypto, and a pretty decent 401k. No debt whatsoever. Living in my parents' house rent free (but will probably move out in 2019, and also likely move out of state towards WA or TX). Other than my family's cellphone bill and my car insurance, no major payments.

&amp;#x200B;

What would be some smart things to due with this money? With my salary being 90k at current job, I'd say that 25k sounds plenty for an emergency fund. If anyone is wondering why so much saving, it's towards a down payment for real estate (since I couldn't think of anything else). I'd say I'm pretty responsible with money (so far), but any input is really appreciated! Thanks!

EDIT: I have four years of work experience. And also, when I move out, I'm likely going to rent for a year to ""test the waters"" of the city I've ended up choosing. Lastly, I'm not looking for another job immediately, but that's the way I want it. Want some time off.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway since boss knows my reddit. I&amp;#39;m quitting work on my 25th birthday. The company has been decent to work for, but my work/life balance got way too out of hand this year. First job I had out of uni, 4 years in, calling it over at this point. Ready for something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m located in the US. I&amp;#39;ve got 80k in savings, another 20k spread out over crypto, and a pretty decent 401k. No debt whatsoever. Living in my parents&amp;#39; house rent free (but will probably move out in 2019, and also likely move out of state towards WA or TX). Other than my family&amp;#39;s cellphone bill and my car insurance, no major payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would be some smart things to due with this money? With my salary being 90k at current job, I&amp;#39;d say that 25k sounds plenty for an emergency fund. If anyone is wondering why so much saving, it&amp;#39;s towards a down payment for real estate (since I couldn&amp;#39;t think of anything else). I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m pretty responsible with money (so far), but any input is really appreciated! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Does Aetna require the use of a specific HSA account or do you bring your own HSA account to the plan and give them the information so they can deposit their $62.50 monthly into the account? I want to know this so I can research the required HSA or research a good one that I can bring to the plan. For that matter, if anyone here has recommendations on an HSA to bring to this plan, I am all ears.

* If I transfer to this health insurance in the second week of December 2018, can I somehow maximize my contribution for 2018? If so, how do I go about calculating and doing this?

I read up a bit on this and it seems like as long as I am eligible for my HSA through 2019, I can make the contribution for 2018. However I do not know how to calculate how much I should contribute. Wouldn't Aetna be contributing 62.50 in December of 2018? So I would have to take this into consideration right? I will be honest, this process is very confusing to me, so a thorough run through of this process would be helpful for me.

It would be awesome if a current federal employee or someone using this plan could chime in.

I am undergoing a career change that carries with it a significant increase in income. I retired from the military and lucked out with an amazing new job starting in a few weeks. My income will go from about $75k to around $150k, and from one steam of income to three: military pension, VA disability, and new salary. That's going to be about an extra $4k at least  per month which is nuts. 

This puts my wife and I in a completely new situation financially and I want to make sure we are prepared to handle this sudden influx of money. We have lived below our means for years and had about 6 months expenses saved up, but that has eroded down to about 3 now for several reasons, one of which is an 8 week gap between my last paycheck and the next. We can handle that no problem and are also funding a nice vacation in the mountains during my time off. But I want to be prepared so I don't go crazy blowing money when it starts to rain in a few weeks. (I'm lusting after an orange Jaguar convertible, send help)

We have zero debt except for our home, which only has about $77k left. We use our credit card near daily and pay it off every night. We live in a lower cost of living area in the Southeast where there is basically nothing to do. We self-levelized all our bills years ago and set up multiple funds for various expenses that we fund throughout the year. Our finances are largely on autopilot already. 

My thoughts are to build up our emergency fund back up to *at least* $30k (it was that before...) and then start slamming money into the house. Wife desperately needs a new car, hers is 12 years old and worth about $1500 on a good day, so I'll get her a late model replacement. She is an amazing woman who struggled her entire life, so I want to set up and maintain a ""kindness fund"" account with a few thousand kept in it that she can use on anyone she meets anytime to help them out. 

Other than that I'm stumped on what to do with the money. Invest for sure, but I'm focused on the shorter term right now, what we need to think about over the next few weeks/months to get nailed down. Things like financial planning/legal/insurance/etc concerns. I need guidance.

Background: I am a graduate student and have accumulated an enormous amount of debt (~180k from undergrad also) and I have two years left in my program. I so far was able to only take out loans for tuition but unfortunately this summer and now this  semester I needed to take out a graduate plus loan in order to live and pay bills.

I took out the full amount this semester (16k) and wanted to send back however much I didn’t use but here’s my question:

Would it make sense to pay off the loan I took out during the summer with this money? That loan was only around $6k and so I think I would have enough money to pay it off with the interest accrued from May.

And is this something I could continue to do for the next two years of school? Get a loan and use my newer loan to pay off my older ones so they do not have time to accrue too much interest or is this completely ridiculous and not worth the hassle?

***also I have 120 days to send back any unused money and not be charged that interest/fees associated with (as if I didn’t take it out)

McDonald in his book about the failure (in September 2008) of the firm he traded for ([Lehman Brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers)), wrote of the hyper-inflated housing market:

&gt;In times past, buying a home required sufficient personal capital to make a s*izable down payment*, usually 20 percent, sometimes a little more. It also required the person to sit right down in front of the banker or mortgage executive and prove beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt annual income, job, and prospects of remaining employed. In many cases people were asked what they proposed to do about the mortgage if for any reason they became unemployed. And *honesty was a watchword, because the local banker was an integral part of the community, a familiar figure, who shared schools, sports, and friendships with many of his clients. These were the standards of American banking,* and they had stood the test of time, the pivotal issue being in every case the reliability of the customer and his ability to repay the money his home had cost.  
&gt;  
&gt;But as the year 2004 drew to a close, there was a brand-new culture in real estate. *The mortgage broker was no longer the lender*, because he was about to unload the whole package, one thousand mortgages at a time, to Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch for the now-well-established parceling-out process, masterminded by the ratings agencies, Fitch, Moody’s, and S&amp;P. So the brokerage house did not care what happened after that, because *they no longer had their own capital on the line*. And those bodybuilder salesmen, those affable Californians, were free to run amok among lower-middle-income earners and sell them anything they darned pleased. There were no standards, no consequences, no responsibilities, and no recriminations. Because, and I stress this once more, *nobody cared*. There was no need. The brokerage firms could sell *any and every mortgage they wrote*, sell it on to Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch, or any other major U.S. bank, on faraway Wall Street.

And Larry McDonald was right:  **nobody cared,** because they were all getting their share.  If it was nothing but elaborate con job, it relied on a willfully uninformed public, all eager to be part of it.  Everyone was eager to believe what no one should have.

Mortgage lending was no longer a simple legal contract between a lender (of his own money) and a borrower who invested something of his own in the bargain (like a down-payment).  A mortgage was no longer a contract, made in good faith, between two people who shook hands and made each other a promise.  An old-fashioned notion, right?  I know it is; that doesn't make it wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my own story:

In 1995, I completed the construction of my first and only newly-built home, and went ""mortgage shopping."" And it really was ""shopping"". It was my first and only home mortgage. I evaluated the options, including two of the most-advertised Internet mortgage lenders of the day (one of those was Countrywide Financial, which financed 20% of all U.S. mortgages in 2006). The Internet was an attractive option to me; I was comfortable with it, the rates were very competitive, and it seemed the easiest and quickest way to get approved. I asked friends and coworkers who financed their homes if they could offer advice on selecting a lender.  They all suggested one of the easy financing options with an ultra-low ""teaser"" rate.

We weren't shopping for a refinance, or a no-down-payment mortgage, or a negative amortization loan (in which the principle grows) or a reverse mortgage, or a no-documentation mortgage, or an adjustable-rate mortgage, or a balloon mortgage, or a cash-back mortgage.  We weren't interested in any of the sales gimmicks from any of the new mortgage lenders who were not even banks (like Countrywide),   We weren't interested in any of those fancy new easy-money mortgages.  These were all ""shadow banks"" to begin with.  They weren't real banks with depositors and carefully managed money to lend.  They didn't hold mortgages as assets.  They packaged and resold them to investors in far-away places.  They weren't proper banks, because *they didn't have any money.*  They were lenders who had to borrow money in order to make mortgage loans.  They were lending money that wasn't their own on easy terms because they got it themselves on easy terms.

In 1995, we wanted a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.  Just as conventional, straight-down-the-line as possible, thank you very much.  Don't try to confuse us with your marketing BS.  That's why we chose a well-established statewide bank (Amsouth Bank was founded in 1873) with a local branch in my hometown. My wife and I met with the bank's Loan Officer, we arranged for a property appraisal, we read and understood all the documents before we signed them. We made an appointment, we went and sat down with a bank manager, we shook hands on the deal. I felt really good about it.  We formed a long-term business relationship.

Several months later, we received a notice in the mail from some company I had never heard of that told us our loan had been ""purchased"" and we would be issued new payment books. The payment amount and schedule would not change, we'd just be sending our checks to a different company each month.

I was furious. I called my bank for an explanation and was told that my mortgage had been sold. ""It's a very standard practice,"" the loan officer told me. ""*Not* with ***my*** loan, it isn't!"" I replied.  I was outraged.

I didn't choose my local branch of Amsouth Bank arbitrarily. I chose their bank because I wanted a relationship, based on mutual trust, that would last the 30 years of my loan, hopefully longer. And that bank, its officers, took my trust, my confidence, my goodwill, and they sold it to the highest bidder.  They sold my *trust.*  

What they did is called ""[securitization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization)"", and since the 1970's, it has become a common practice in the banking/mortgage lending business. My mortgage was packaged along with many others, and put on the market as a ""Mortgage-Backed Security"" (MBS); it was bid on and purchased by a company that wanted it for a cash-flow investment. Amsouth Bank, like many other banks today, was no longer in the business of ""portfolio management"", they had no intention of holding my mortgage, or retaining me as a customer; they sold us both for what the market would bear.

They called it ""standard practice."" In the sense that it is a *common practice* in their industry, and a *completely legal practice*, I suppose that it is ""standard practice"". But I call it *bad business*. Furthermore, it represents a profound change in the process of mortgage lending.

Ok, I know I'm old school, and my entire notion of doing long-term business with an established bank in my hometown; that whole notion of mutual trust and loyalty between me and my hometown banker, the handshake and the promise; it's quaint, and it's obsolete. The Bailey Building and Loan Association closed its doors a long time ago.

I admit, I'm the one who was wrong.  I am the one who was under the misconception that Amsouth Bank and I had a two-way contract which neither of us could break without the consent of the other.  I am the one with the ""quaint old-fashioned notions"" of hometown banking, of responsible lending, and responsible borrowing, of debt as a contract between two parties acting in mutual good faith.

These big corporate banks want a system in which trust, openness, honesty, mutual respect, and loyalty have no relevance.  And, it would appear most Americans agree with them (as long as they see profit in it for themselves).

That's fine for *others* ... but I chose to live *my* life differently.  I'm satisfied with *my own* choice.  And I'll watch the success or failure of the debt-based economy from the sidelines, thank you very much.

I'm out of this game.  I would like to add, though, that many others would've been wise to get out sooner.  The number of people I know, personally, who have been forced to postpone their planned retirements tells me that's true.

McDonald in his book about the failure (in September 2008) of the firm he traded for (&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers""&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;), wrote of the hyper-inflated housing market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In times past, buying a home required sufficient personal capital to make a s&lt;em&gt;izable down payment&lt;/em&gt;, usually 20 percent, sometimes a little more. It also required the person to sit right down in front of the banker or mortgage executive and prove beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt annual income, job, and prospects of remaining employed. In many cases people were asked what they proposed to do about the mortgage if for any reason they became unemployed. And &lt;em&gt;honesty was a watchword, because the local banker was an integral part of the community, a familiar figure, who shared schools, sports, and friendships with many of his clients. These were the standards of American banking,&lt;/em&gt; and they had stood the test of time, the pivotal issue being in every case the reliability of the customer and his ability to repay the money his home had cost.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the year 2004 drew to a close, there was a brand-new culture in real estate. &lt;em&gt;The mortgage broker was no longer the lender&lt;/em&gt;, because he was about to unload the whole package, one thousand mortgages at a time, to Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch for the now-well-established parceling-out process, masterminded by the ratings agencies, Fitch, Moody’s, and S&amp;amp;P. So the brokerage house did not care what happened after that, because &lt;em&gt;they no longer had their own capital on the line&lt;/em&gt;. And those bodybuilder salesmen, those affable Californians, were free to run amok among lower-middle-income earners and sell them anything they darned pleased. There were no standards, no consequences, no responsibilities, and no recriminations. Because, and I stress this once more, &lt;em&gt;nobody cared&lt;/em&gt;. There was no need. The brokerage firms could sell &lt;em&gt;any and every mortgage they wrote&lt;/em&gt;, sell it on to Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch, or any other major U.S. bank, on faraway Wall Street.  &lt;/p&gt;

2. We do have a total of &gt;$25k and counting in a savings account, earning a measly &lt;2%. With impending changes to my job situation - is there a safe avenue for investing this money to see if we can safely get better rates?

3. Any other tips or pieces of advice?

Not sure if this is the right place for this, so just let me know if not.

I purchased a new car back in 2016, and have decided to sell it. I financed the car, and still owe money on the loan and was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to go about selling a vehicle I don’t have the title for. I’ve done some online research, but haven’t seen many details outside of “contact your loan company”.

Let’s say I can sell the car for 15k, and only have 12k left on the loan. What is the best way to go about this? My initial thought was to have the buyer work with my loan company to pay off the loan, and to have the loan company send them the title, but how would I go about getting the 3k difference? I doubt any buyer would be comfortable giving me that money before having a title in hand, so in the instance I’d have to wait until they got the title before getting the 3k, how would I be able to protect myself? (I.e. they get the title but don’t send me the 3k).

Sure, I’d have a bill of sale signed etc, but I feel like it would be a huge hassle and cost to try and get in a legal battle over that difference. 

Any thoughts?

I’m planning on going to college in the next year and I need to know how to budget my money. 

First I’ll start with the basics:

I’m 19 years old

I live in BC, Canada (probably will attend school within BC)

Currently backpacking and working in Australia. I should be able to leave here with $5K. 

I sold my truck to backpack Australia so I’ll need a vehicle to get to school. Public transportation isn’t an option where I live. 

I’m not exactly what I want to take but it will be something along the lines on computer science. It should be around $5K a school year. 

(http://www.okanagan.bc.ca/student_services/registrar/tuition.html)

My parent said I can live in their house for free as long as I go to school so rent isn’t an issue. 

When I’m back I’m probably going to have to work for minimum wage because my city isn’t doing the best financially. I have a job I can come back to that makes me $400 a week roughly. I can make more money during the summer break as the province needs people to help fight fires. I can’t tell you how much I’d make during the break though. 

I believe I can use part of the RSP to help with the purchase of a vehicle. Would it be smart to spend a little bit more in order to have a vehicle that I can trust? How much should I try and make during the summer to help out with the cost of the schooling? How much of the $24K should I put towards each semester and how much should be of my earned money?

I am quite confident these were authorized donations because he donated messages in German and his donation email address is a .de (german) email address.

I called Paypal multiple times who reassured me things would most likely work out in my favor. 

I responded to the dispute with a long letter to PayPal explaining what live streaming is and how trolls charge back donations.

Despite this Paypal sided with him and returned the $1,000 to his bank account.

I called Paypal and they told me there is nothing I can do, no way to appeal this further, once it's been decided it's finished.

I went to my local garda station (police) who didn't seem to understand what live streaming was or chargebacks were and because of this didn't formally issue a fraud complaint.

I was in an accident recently, it's been ruled the other's fault,  their insurance agreed and offered their property damage coverage for the vehicle and various expenses related to property (buy back of my stuff that's cut by EMT and such), and liability limit of 100k for injuries, and everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

I had pretty serious injuries, but also pretty good health insurance with Kaiser. So far, other than some over-the-counter drugs I've seen all 0's in my copay amount, that includes a few surgeries, anesthetic, hospital stays. Although the total that was paid by my health insurance exceeds 100k.

&amp;#x200B;

When I talked to the adjuster from the other's insurance, he said my health insurance may want a piece of that 100k settlement, probably not 100% of the cost but like 1/2 the settlement, or so he said.

&amp;#x200B;

I called Kaiser, who uses Equian as their ... accident-liaison... or whatever you call them. The rep I spoke to @ Equian said they'd contact the auto insurance on my behalf and go after either/or both insurance and the other party, and that what they do doesn't affect my decision to settle or not. This was yesterday, and I intend to call back sometime next week when they have an ""examiner"" assigned to my case to clarify my confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

So... that's more or less what happened so far. Other than hospital-related expenses, I had to hire home helper as I live alone and pretty much bed-bound after the accident.

&amp;#x200B;

The title pretty much has the general of my question, what part of the insurance payout can my health insurance lay claim on, if any? Is it just because my health insurance is super good (my job is unionized) that I have 0 copays for all these major operations, or since they know the injuries are from an accident, they're just waiting to get a slice of that settlement? Whose word is true, the adjuster or the rep @ Equian? My understanding is that if I take the policy limit settlement, I forfeit the right to sue the other party, which I don't mind if my health insurance isn't going to take a bite out of the settlement, but I'm suing if my health insurance will. Clearly the other party has money (higher than minimum liability, expensive car, bad driver, etc...).

I have 0 income and am living with my parents in Texas while I find a job.

There is a free/reduced cost clinic in our city that I decided to go see so that I could get the help I need with the income level that I have. After some total bullshit trying to get into the clinic (which is too long of a story), I finally managed to finally see a caseworker who got me in to see their clinician.

At no point during the course of the intake evaluation was I informed of any cost. I was told that since I have no income, they should be able to waive any costs incurred while attending the clinic. However, they asked me for my insurance information during the visit, which I provided without much of a second thought.

This clinic requires you to provide a urine sample at each visit. They make you sign a paper when providing the urine sample that says the patient is financially responsible for the urinalysis, but since I was under the impression that the cost would be waived, I did it anyways.

I only attended one appointment but immediately after the appointment I asked to speak with someone in the financial department about the text on the urinalysis paper just to be sure. Apparently even though I should've been waived the cost of clinic visits, they would still bill my insurance and I'd be responsible for anything insurance didn't cover. It just so happens this clinic is out-of-network, and thus I would have to pay the full cost since I haven't met my out-of-network deductible for the year. I pleaded to them if I could drop to uninsured status, but they said, ""Uh... No, it doesn't work that way.""

So what was originally a plan to save money ended up costing me way more money than if I'd just gone to a regular psychiatrist in-network. After this happened, I refused to continue attending the clinic, or take any of the medications they provided.

This past Thursday, I finally received the final bill from that one visit and it was $154.23 which is 5x more than a regular psychiatrist. I decided I just wanted to put this entire ordeal behind me, and paid it immediately yesterday (Friday).

Well today (Saturday), I get another bill in the mail from the lab that my urinalysis was sent to and it's $178. So in total, with the urinalysis bill and the clinic bill, it ended up costing me 11x more than a regular psychiatrist. If I would've known that the urinalysis would be billed separately, I would not have paid that bill yesterday: a benefit to this clinic is that they will subtract any costs you incur from medications and such from your total bill. I would like to dispute the fact that I paid yesterday so that I can resubmit my payment with the $178 as an incurred cost. However, what recourse do I have for disputing a payment in this regard?

I used a debit card to pay, and according to my transaction log the charge is pending until Monday (the 10th). When the charge posts completely, have I essentially lost that money? Can I still dispute it? Neither the clinic nor my credit union are open on Sunday for me to dispute it sooner, so the earliest I can do so is when the charge posts completely. However, with zero income this is more money than I would hope to part with.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in June, I decided to pursue psychiatric help.

&lt;p&gt;Well today (Saturday), I get another bill in the mail from the lab that my urinalysis was sent to and it&amp;#39;s $178. So in total, with the urinalysis bill and the clinic bill, it ended up costing me 11x more than a regular psychiatrist. If I would&amp;#39;ve known that the urinalysis would be billed separately, I would not have paid that bill yesterday: a benefit to this clinic is that they will subtract any costs you incur from medications and such from your total bill. I would like to dispute the fact that I paid yesterday so that I can resubmit my payment with the $178 as an incurred cost. However, what recourse do I have for disputing a payment in this regard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a debit card to pay, and according to my transaction log the charge is pending until Monday (the 10th). When the charge posts completely, have I essentially lost that money? Can I still dispute it? Neither the clinic nor my credit union are open on Sunday for me to dispute it sooner, so the earliest I can do so is when the charge posts completely. However, with zero income this is more money than I would hope to part with.&lt;/p&gt;

This past year and a half really took the wind out of me. After a series of medical issues, family crises, Harvey wrecking our home and losing some of my regular income, I felt pretty defeated. I ended up missing payments and moved those funds towards other needs (house repairs, helping younger brother pay for tuition, blah, blah, life) until I was really overwhelmed. Long story short, I let it go on way too long and now my credit score is in the toilet, currently sitting at a 519. I have multiple delinquencies and late payments affecting my score. I'm in a position now where I can start repairing my credit but I need some advice as to how to go about it.

I've researched some and seen that hiring attorneys to dispute delinquencies and late payments can work, but I don't want to end up hiring people who are doing something that I could do myself. Does anyone have any experience with these agencies? Are they worth it? Is it something I could do myself or would it be better to let them try? I also know that some creditors may negotiate with you and take the delinquency off your account if you pay the debt or may take off the late payment. Is this feasible? They are all newish so it's not an option to just wait until they come off my score in 7 years.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Additional question: If I'm able to negotiate the collections/deliquencies off of my credit, not just marked as settled, but actually taken off, will my credit score increase as if they never happened?\*

Looking for some advice on what to do with a little extra CF coming from a rental property.  Our goal was to save 3 months mortgage payment in the bank before we started using the CF for other things; we are about 2 months from hitting our savings target and we'll have about $300 in CF if we decide to put that money towards other things.  

The options are: 

Pay down the principle of the above mentioned rental property.  Its a 30 year 4% loan about 3 years in. 

Pay down the loan on our travel trailer. 10 year ~5% loan, 1 year in

Pay down my car payment.  3 years left, 3.3% APR. 

Pay down the principle our duplex (currently living in 1/2 and renting the other) and thus reduce our mortgage payment. 30 year @ 4.25%, less than 1 year in. 

Pay down my partner's CC debt (we are not married but own the property equally/jointly).  Varying interest rates from 8-15% (estimating here). 

Even if you are not able to provide explicit answers because there are specifics missing, guidance on how to think through this will be helpful.

The family is in a bit of trouble. My mom quietly told me about her credit card debt. At first, she only disclosed a 10k debt. Then it was actually 14k.

I'm wondering if it's possible to do a balance transfer to a personal card, either hers or mine. I'm not sure if she would get approved, she said her credit score is apparently too low? 

 We've only have 1k each in savings. My brother will also be helping pay down the debt. I'm thinking a 0% balance transfer, if possible to a new card under me, or a loan.

Hello, college student here. Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about getting started on building my credit. I currently have:

- A 1k Emergency Fund

- Around 5k in a high interest savings account

- About 2k in a simple checking account

- No student loan debt 

- No income/job

- No monthly subscription services

I have a scholarship that will pay for most of my college expenses, with the rest covered by my parents, so I don’t need to worry about paying for school. I’m generally pretty frugal and only spend money on the necessities (food, clothes, etc.). I’m considering the Discover It Chrome Card, or the Discover It Student if I get rejected. 

So my question now is if I should get the card even though I don’t spend a lot each month? I don’t have any monthly subscription services like Hulu, Spotify, Cable, etc. and I don’t have a car so I don’t pay for gas. I do eat out with friends fairly often, however, around 1-2 times a week. My monthly spending is roughly estimated about $75 to eat out and $25 for miscellaneous items. I do have some other expenses like groceries and laundry, but I don’t actually pay out of pocket for those. I’ll use the card whenever I need to make a payment and pay it off in full every month.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks to everyone for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1k Emergency Fund&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 5k in a high interest savings account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2k in a simple checking account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No student loan debt &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No income/job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No monthly subscription services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a scholarship that will pay for most of my college expenses, with the rest covered by my parents, so I don’t need to worry about paying for school. I’m generally pretty frugal and only spend money on the necessities (food, clothes, etc.). I’m considering the Discover It Chrome Card, or the Discover It Student if I get rejected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question now is if I should get the card even though I don’t spend a lot each month? I don’t have any monthly subscription services like Hulu, Spotify, Cable, etc. and I don’t have a car so I don’t pay for gas. I do eat out with friends fairly often, however, around 1-2 times a week. My monthly spending is roughly estimated about $75 to eat out and $25 for miscellaneous items. I do have some other expenses like groceries and laundry, but I don’t actually pay out of pocket for those. I’ll use the card whenever I need to make a payment and pay it off in full every month.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm in massive debt. I'll do the best I can to explain the situation, but I'm really feeling helpless here and not seeing a way out of this dark hole I've dug myself. I know exactly what got me into this situation, but I need help getting out...
So last year the love of my life left me after four years (I'm in my 30s). Being so utterly distraught and feeling destroyed, I did what any insane person would do - I had my midlife crisis a little early. The job I contracted at ended in December 2017, contract ran out of money, wasn't by choice. So I stupidly believed chasing my dreams was worth a shot. I bought a very expensive RV for around $80,000. I travelled the country for 3 short months before realizing my grave mistake. I came back to my senses only to slip in to deep depression, knowing it was going to be impossible to get out. I quit my career to use marijuana medically and now that has absolutely killed any chance of the income I was previously earning.
So here's a real break down of my situation:
Income:
Disability check: $1,365/month
Part-time catering job: $280/month
Other income (DoorDash, Uber/Lyft, etc.): varies but usually around $600/ month
Total: $2,245
Monthly Debt:
Rent: $400
RV payment: $672 (at 7% interest 😭)
Car payment: $266
Car insurance for both vehicles: $ 146
Cellphone: $100
Gas: $100
Groceries: $280
Other debt owed:
Back taxes: $5,000+ (see below)
CC: $1,000
Student loans: $45,000 (currently in deferment but I only have ONE class left before I have to pay again)
My two most major issues are the back taxes I owe from when I was contracting and this RV. I've gotten so overwhelmed with everything that I don't even know where to start. Last year was my first time being an individual contractor. I had no idea I had to pay taxes quarterly. I also didn't understand that I have to pay both mine AND my employer's portions of social security and whatnot. Hard lesson learned, but I didn't ever save for their portion because I didn't know. So where do I start to let the IRS know that I can't pay what they originally asked? I don't make the same income and I'll never be able to pay them with what I make right now...
Now the RV. I bought it brand new Jan 2018. I know this was dumb, I've beat myself stupid over it already. It's had a lot of issues keeping a charge with the battery. It's failed four times now to keep a charge and several batteries have been put into the vehicle. I keep telling the manufacturer that there is obviously a parasitic draw somewhere...whatever. They keep blaming the consumer saying I don't drive it enough or start it up enough. I start it up at least once every 2 weeks and I drove it for 3 months straight everyday. Since it's been so many times I'm considering suing under my state's Lemon Law. I've had it up for sale, but with it being so new, no one wants to pay that much since it isn't at a dealer. I don't know how to get out from under this thing...or the rest of this debt...
Any help at all is appreciated. I can provide more info if necessary. I'm sure there's something I forgot in here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guys, I&amp;#39;m not seeing much of a way out here. I&amp;#39;m in massive debt.

I still have the return receipt proving we returned it the same day we took it. What can I do next? Capital one has denied my claim. 

May 23 2018: I reserved a Chevrolet Cruze or similar vehicle from Avis in Salt Lake City, Utah for the dates of June 13 2018 to June 16 2018, costing $255.53. I prepayed for the vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

On the Company 401K Highlights Handbook, it says:   

&gt;**YOUR EMPLOYERS CONTRIBUTIONS**   
&gt;  
&gt;The employer may make contributions to your account; this amount may vary from year to year.   
&gt;  
&gt;In 2018, federal tax law allows employee and employer contributions up to a combined total of $55,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less.   
&gt;  
&gt;You can direct employer contributions to any investment in your plan.   
&gt;  
&gt;**WHAT IS VESTING?**   
&gt;  
&gt;""Vesting"" refers to your ownership of the money in your account. You are always 100% vested in your own contributions, but it may take longer to become vested in your employer’s contributions. Refer to the vesting schedule for details about your employer contributions.   
&gt;  
&gt;The vesting schedule below applies to the following source:   
&gt;  
&gt;COMPANY MATCH 

You will be vested in your employer contributions based on the following vesting schedule: 

|Years of Service|Percentage Vested|
|:-|:-|
|After 2 Years|20%|
|After 3 Years|40%|
|After 4 Years|60%|
|After 5 Years|100%|

&amp;#x200B;

In the Salary Savings Plan Handbook, it says:



&gt;**EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Matching Contributions**   
&gt;  
&gt;Once you have met the requirements to participate in the Plan with respect to Matching Contributions, as described in **ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE: ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS** above, you may receive Matching Contributions for a Plan Year only if you are employed as a Covered Employee on the last day of the Plan Year.   
&gt;  
&gt;If you are eligible, each Plan Year your Employer, in its discretion, may make a Matching Contribution to your Account equal to a percentage, determined by your Employer, of your 401(k) Contributions to the Plan for the Plan Year.   
&gt;  
&gt;Your Employer will match your Catch-Up 401(k) Contributions to the Plan. 

And the rest is the same Vesting Schedule explained above.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just illiterate and it's right there in the writing or do I have to contact HR to explain?

&amp;#x200B;

Another question: In the Company 401K Highlights Handbook it also gives me 30 different investment options. Are these types of 401K Investment options or just other options that the company can provide as well?



&gt;**SALARY SAVINGS PLAN offers a selection of investments to choose from. You can decide how you want your money invested, and may move money between investments anytime. Please refer to the disclosures at the end of this section for a description of any restrictions that may apply.**

I'm studying Chemical Engineering, and I recently got hired for a co-op engineering position. I'm over the moon to say the least! I'll be doing 3 rotations in total, tallying up to 12 months total, working full-time. My rotations will be Spring 2019, Summer 2020 and Summer 2021. The pay is really nice, at $18/hr starting. 

I'll work January 2019-beginning May 2019, 40 hours a week at $18/hr for my first rotation. 

My dad has been paying out of pocket for my college so far. I got a pretty hefty scholarship, and chose the cheapest school I got into, so he's been covering the remaining tuition, books, rent, utilities, and grocery money. I'll be graduating without any debt. (I realize that I'm extremely lucky). 

Items that I will not have to spend my co-op salary on:

* Rent- The company is giving me a $600/month stipend for housing. My rent is $700/month, and the remaining $100 is being covered by my dad. 
* Utilities- Dad is covering.
* Groceries- Dad is covering. 
* Future tuition- Dad will be covering. 

However, I will need a car to get to and from my new job. Warning, I know nothing about cars! My dad has a 2012 Toyota Highlander that's in really good shape. He's offered to lend it to me until I graduate, and all I would have to cover would be gas, maintenance, and insurance. He's also willing to sell me the car, it's worth around $15,000 right now, and he would break it up into monthly payments, due to him during the seasons that I work on co-op. 

I really want my own car and to feel more independent, but $15,000 is a lot of money. Right now I'm leaning towards just borrowing the Highlander from him, and then investing later on in a different car once I graduate with my degree and get an even better paying position. 

Any insight into the car situation would be really helpful. 

Now for the fun part! My boyfriend and I have been talking about marriage for nearly a year now. I really don't care about being traditional, I just want to marry this amazing man. I've offered to pay entirely for our engagement ring, and leave him to pop the question once it's shipped to us. My boyfriend is studying Computer Engineering and will be graduating with his degree this coming May. He will be staying in our college's city, where the starting salary for his field is around $65,000/year. He will also be graduating without any debt, but of course it's a little rocky when you first graduate. So that why I've offered to pay. 

I want to buy an engagement ring for us around May, so that we can make it official in the summer! We've been looking at engagement rings online, and are a little lost. It appears that you have to drop around $500 at least to get something with long-lasting quality that won't break in a couple years. I've found a ring that I'm in love with for $1260, but I really have no idea how much I should be looking to spend on a ring. Not a huge fan of diamonds- at best they seem expensive and at worst they seem downright unethical. I'm more interested in color gemstone rings and opals, but I want the metal band and stone to be a good quality. Something that I can wear forever. 

If someone could just look at my info and give a general ballpark of how much I should spend on a ring, that would be very helpful.

We bought our condo here in Houston TX about a year ago, and haven’t built very much equity in it. We are 26 and 32 and we were first time home buyers. We were rushing to do things we wanted to do, maybe not making the best financial choices, because my husband had a heart attack due to a defect not long before that, and everything seemed urgent.

A. Sell it and take the loss. Use the return as a down payment, but downgrade on our next house

B. Invest the 18k return so we can use it as down payment later, just rent something in NE for a while. 

C. Live in it for a couple years, hope the market doesn’t take a bad turn, and put the next part of our lives on hold.

&lt;p&gt;A. Sell it and take the loss. Use the return as a down payment, but downgrade on our next house&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Invest the 18k return so we can use it as down payment later, just rent something in NE for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. Live in it for a couple years, hope the market doesn’t take a bad turn, and put the next part of our lives on hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice? We’re stressed due to everything else, and just stumped. Do people sell houses at a loss, or would that be the dumbest choice ever? &lt;/p&gt;

I have my 6-month emergency fund and also 50k in cash (for dollar-cost averaging -- I just opened a personal 401k and started investing).

1. Ask for proof from each agency of debt owed (w/o confirming/admitting to debt owed)

2. If debt is valid, ask for 'pay for removal' for each of them (even the ones that are like $35.00)

It took some time for my husband to find a job in state B, so we had to pay both a mortgage, rent, and utilities for both places for a while, and ended up with a lot of credit card debt. After he got a job here, we then needed to spend a lot of money to renovate the house in order to rent it out. As our utilization was already high at this point, we didn't manage to qualify for additional credit, so we had to increase our utilization even higher. 

The good news is that we now have a tenant and more than enough income to cover our daily expenses. The problem is that we now have a lot of credit card debt. Our combined CC debt is about $50k, with some of this being in my name only, some of it in his name only, and some joint. A lot of our cards have low limits, so this debt is currently scattered on 18 different cards, which are all basically maxed out. About $20k of this debt is on cards with an interest rate above 20%! I also have one CC with a zero balance and a $5500 limit. 

We are currently able to pay the minimum on everything plus several hundred extra, which we are throwing at the highest interest debt. The problem is that we are paying so much in interest that we are barely making any progress on the principal! I'm also particularly concerned that about $15k of this is on cards that have promotional rates that end in the spring or early summer.

I currently have a job but doesn't pay too well ($12.75/hr , $15.75/hr Sunday only) and went around looking for either a second job or 1 job that'll pay better. I looked around Craigslist and found an ad for a plumber helper and so I emailed them and got a call and spoke with the guy. 

 The guy told me they would pay me as a 1099 contractor and I'm just confused on what that is and how it will affect me when I pay taxes. A quick rundown of what he told me about the job is it's On-call and commission, and there is a minimum payout of $600 for the week. For the commission part he said I would get 10% of whatever the job is. Now I have no experience in it and he said all is well as I'll learn on the job with the lead technician. It's 50 hours on call usually 8am - 6pm and it's in the Nassau area of long island. I'm in the Suffolk area meaning depending on where the job is, I'll either drive 10 minutes away from home or 45 minutes away. 

 The question is how is a 1099 contractor usually paid? He said I would have to go to his office (about 45 mins from where I live) to get paid. Now are taxes taken out directly or do I get the full amount and have to pay taxes when I file?

 The current job I'm at I only make about $300 a week since I don't work much hours, would this job be more beneficial for more though? As far as rent, it's $1,000 a month and I don't got to pay utilities. It's at my dad's home and he said he would help us out as my girlfriend and her family are being kicked out from the landlord and her mom said she's only looking for a room for herself and her boyfriend. Me and my girlfriend have been together for 5 years we were planning on moving out regardless but I want to make sure I'll be making enough to support us as well ( we will be going half on certain things ) .

 P.S the guy did say I'll be on call for 50 hours but might only work 30 hours roughly a week, on average about 12-15 shifts.. at times I'll leave with the minimum $600 and also there'll be times I leave with $800 plus he said depending on the week and if I choose extra hours.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all, recently my girlfriend and I are moving into an apartment in February. I currently have a job but doesn&amp;#39;t pay too well ($12.75/hr , $15.75/hr Sunday only) and went around looking for either a second job or 1 job that&amp;#39;ll pay better. I looked around Craigslist and found an ad for a plumber helper and so I emailed them and got a call and spoke with the guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy told me they would pay me as a 1099 contractor and I&amp;#39;m just confused on what that is and how it will affect me when I pay taxes. A quick rundown of what he told me about the job is it&amp;#39;s On-call and commission, and there is a minimum payout of $600 for the week. For the commission part he said I would get 10% of whatever the job is. Now I have no experience in it and he said all is well as I&amp;#39;ll learn on the job with the lead technician. It&amp;#39;s 50 hours on call usually 8am - 6pm and it&amp;#39;s in the Nassau area of long island. I&amp;#39;m in the Suffolk area meaning depending on where the job is, I&amp;#39;ll either drive 10 minutes away from home or 45 minutes away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is how is a 1099 contractor usually paid? He said I would have to go to his office (about 45 mins from where I live) to get paid. Now are taxes taken out directly or do I get the full amount and have to pay taxes when I file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current job I&amp;#39;m at I only make about $300 a week since I don&amp;#39;t work much hours, would this job be more beneficial for more though? As far as rent, it&amp;#39;s $1,000 a month and I don&amp;#39;t got to pay utilities. It&amp;#39;s at my dad&amp;#39;s home and he said he would help us out as my girlfriend and her family are being kicked out from the landlord and her mom said she&amp;#39;s only looking for a room for herself and her boyfriend. Me and my girlfriend have been together for 5 years we were planning on moving out regardless but I want to make sure I&amp;#39;ll be making enough to support us as well ( we will be going half on certain things ) .&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks in advance for any advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just graduated and got a new job at an investment firm. I make around $40K/year. I want to figure out the best way to pay off any debt that I have. I'm in the grace period for my student loans until November.  I allocate 5% of my pay to savings, 5% to a money market fund/Roth IRA, and 10% to charity. I pay \~$50/mo for medical/dental/vision through an employer plan and they take 4% out of my pay towards a Roth 401(k). I'm over my credit limit for both cards but haven't made any purchases in over 2 months. Never miss a payment on anything. It's hard to get back to my credit limit because the monthly interest charges are taking up most of my minimum payment amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Monthly Pay: \~$2,200*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Monthly Expenses: \~$1,400*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Savings: $2,100*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Debt***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Phone: $460 at 0%*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Car Loan - $4,200 at 3.24%*

&gt;  
&gt;*Credit Card 2: $2,865 at 21.74%*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Student Loan: $22,000*

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my current plan of paying it all off: 

1. Freeze my credit cards to stop me from making any purchases.
2. Use Homebudget to track my spending.
3. Use any bonuses or additional income towards paying off my credit cards first. 
4. I'm considering a second job as an Amazon Flex or Lyft driver to further pay it off. Would this be a good idea? What other lines of work would you suggest in addition to a full-time job? 
5. The credit card interest rates are *killing* me. My credit score keeps going down and interest rates going slightly up. I have no interest in getting another credit card to transfer the balance, but I'm considering a personal loan company like Avant, Upstart, etc. to pay off my credit cards and get a better interest rate. What do you think? Is this a good idea?

I work for a company which requires that I drive because we work in-home with clients. However, we are not compensated for driving until we work 32+ hours a week. Even so, the compensation after 32+ hours a week is based on time and not mileage (e.g., if you drive for 30 minutes then you are paid for half an hour of work). This is clearly problematic because distance can vary. Further, you can only qualify for compensation if there are no gaps between then time it takes to drive and the start of the appointment. For example, if you left client A's house at 12pm, drove for 30 minutes to client B's house, but the appointment didn't start until 12:45pm, then you would not be paid for driving.

This is especially concerning, because we can no longer deduct our miles on our upcoming 2018 taxes.

I drive 40 miles a day for work not including commute. I work less than 32 hours a week, so I receive no compensation. I am paid $19/hr, which is above average for my occupation. In the past I have been told that this is *because* we are not compensated for driving, but I feel at this point we have crossed a line.

So glad I came across this sub, it has been extremely helpful in the past two days I have been reading it. I have spent about 6 hours reading and doing corresponding ""activities"" today alone to get my financials in order. Anywho, on to the reason for my post.


I interned my last two years of college in tech, and ended up getting hired when I graduated this past May. My income is $81.5k yearly before taxes (in CA, so not as cool as if I was getting paid this much where the standard of living is lower). Here are my current mandatory expenses:

* rent - $500/month (I live with my parents, will for about a year)

* vehicle (truck that i bought myself because I sold my old one and wanted something new. Besides family and my girlfriend, this is my one source of true happiness, so I am willing to pay the high expense) - $547/month for payment and insurance (at 2.74%) 

* student loans (still in grace) - $7500 at 3.76%, $3000 at 4.29%, should come out to ~$120/month if I do the 10 year plan

* toll roads (i live in a very traffic-y part of California, and I take the toll roads to avoid 1.5hr+ commutes every day. when i move out in ~1yr these will no longer be used) - $180/month


For now (I am 23), health/life insurance is covered by my parents. This will cease when I turn 26. 


Assets:

* $14k savings (standard bank savings)

* $1600 in a robinhood account comprised of tech stocks

* 7% contribution to 401k with a 3% match

* 15% post-tax ESPP (purchased at 15% discount, sold right once i get it for a safe return)


My budget basically is spend as little as possible but don't be cheap (ie: limit eating out to 1-2x per week, if you need something buy it). This nets me anywhere between $900-$1500 worth of savings per month.


My question is, with my current situation, where would my savings best be spent? As per the wiki, I will be opening and maxing a roth IRA. But besides that, where would this money best be spent? I would like to buy a house by the time I am 30 (maybe earlier), so not quite sure about maxing my 401k at this point. Pay off loans quicker, index funds, stocks, high-yield savings? This is where I get lost and could use some sound advice. The flow chart in the wiki is a good overview, but I have a few different options that I do not see in there.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;15% post-tax ESPP (purchased at 15% discount, sold right once i get it for a safe return)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My budget basically is spend as little as possible but don&amp;#39;t be cheap (ie: limit eating out to 1-2x per week, if you need something buy it). This nets me anywhere between $900-$1500 worth of savings per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, with my current situation, where would my savings best be spent? As per the wiki, I will be opening and maxing a roth IRA. But besides that, where would this money best be spent? I would like to buy a house by the time I am 30 (maybe earlier), so not quite sure about maxing my 401k at this point. Pay off loans quicker, index funds, stocks, high-yield savings? This is where I get lost and could use some sound advice. The flow chart in the wiki is a good overview, but I have a few different options that I do not see in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the long post and my lack of ability to figure out how to format new lines, and I thank everyone in advance for any responses!&lt;/p&gt;

On top of that, my older cat has a tooth fracture and possible extraction ahead of her. The younger cat has had bad gingivitis her whole life, and is at least due for a cleaning.

We've already decided on how to split the proceeds, and I have a general idea of how much I *should* be getting back. But it will be a while yet before we close, as my ex is putting the house on the market in November.

Is it smart to just put everything at Vanguard?

I will plan for my future by expecting them to be worth nothing, but I would like some opinions on what to do if they end up being valuable.

&amp;nbsp;

The underlying stock is worth $100,000 and the options expire in 10 years. The exercise price is the at-the-money price that the stock was at during my first day of employment. A third of the options vest in 1 year, and the other two thirds vest month by month over 2 years. So I will be completely vested in these stock options in 3 years.

&amp;nbsp;

After thinking about it, what my employer is giving me is the extrinsic value of the stock options (The possibility of the stock rising in value over the next 10 years). Thus, I should exercise the stock options when I believe that the extrinsic value is low enough that it is not worth the risk of the stock price decreasing. The question is, when is that?

&amp;nbsp;

If the stock increased in value at 7% per year, the options would be worth $96,715 after 10 years. At 10% per year, they would be worth $159,374 after 10 years. At what point do I exercise them? Would you exercise them all when they hit a certain value? Would you exercise them over time (A sort of Dollar-Cost averaging technique)? It may also be worth noting that this is a biotech company. They have commercial products, but volatility is always a concern in biotech.

&amp;nbsp;

Any opinions on how to handle these down the line, if they become valuable, is much appreciated. I'd like having a plan in place, but am a little unsure on these options since the math isn't concrete.

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you all for your help! &lt;/p&gt;

Greetings,

&amp;#x200B;

I am 34 and my wife is 40 (married late last year).  We expect to make around $200k this year combined, which is about 60-70k higher than previous years because I got a higher paying job. We are expecting a baby in a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

Our only debt is a 30 year mortgage for a house we just bought (we borrowed 270k @ 4.625% ) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have :

$32k in a Roth IRA that is Vanguard Target 2050 (I would be 65 but my wife would be 71 .. )

$15k in checking

&amp;#x200B;

My wife has: 

Traditional IRA with $18k in it

Savings account with $40k

Checking account $3k

$47k in 4 individual energy related stocks

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out what kind of retirement/investment accounts we should be having, if I should consolidate (if possible) the Roth and Traditional IRAs we both have respectively,  and/or roll one or both into my work's new 401k plan, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be happy to pay a reasonable hourly rate for some true professional advice. Any recommendations for that?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other ideas/advice is much appreciated. Thanks!

I had an inspection done and there were no red flags related to cooling. The seller provided a receipt showing the AC was serviced about a month prior and there was one small issue with it that they gave me credit for. I was satisfied with this and wasn't too concerned as they also paid for a home warranty which will cover the AC if it breaks.

I move into the home, and it's immediately noticeable within the first two days something is wrong: it runs all the time, and it only cools the home down to about 80 degrees during the day, and about 70 at night. I live in Arizona where it's normally 100 to 120 outside during the summer.

I installed a Nest thermostat and this confirmed that it runs all the time - normally during the day I see that it never shuts off between 10am and 6pm. This obviously has resulted in a super high energy bill - about $300 a month, when I expect the unit running properly would cut that in half to around $150. It's a relatively small house.

I called up the home warranty, and after having a company come out about 6 separate times (replacing the same part on 4 of those trips), they finally figured out what's wrong and told me that the indoor coil needs cleaning. They showed me pictures of how it was all blocked and restricting air flow which is making the house not cool enough and it needing to run constantly to keep it cool.

The catch? While the home warranty covers mechanical breakdowns, they don't cover cleanings. I will have to pay for it myself which is going to cost $900 for the type of unit I have. I don't have that kind of money to spend right now. If I did it, I would have to put it on a credit card. I stupidly spent all of my savings on the downpayment for the home so have basically nothing left and about 2k in credit card debt.

So I can either pay the $900 now and put it on the credit card, which will save me about $150 a month (which I will then put right back as payments to the credit card). Or I can keep saving and pay for it in cash in about 6 months. I can live comfortably at the temperatures my home is at currently (and we're moving out of summer and into winter soon as well). I did invest a little into putting UV blocking tint and blackout curtains on all the windows. 

So should I just keep paying the high energy bill for now and pay for the cleaning when I can? Or should I get it done now to save money on the energy bill, but pay interest on a credit card while I use the energy savings to pay it off?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently bought my first house.

Rent 1500/month (6 months left on lease)

other fixed costs about $120.00/month

CC debt 15K

student loans: 150K (payment will soon start around 500-600/month).

No transportation costs (work pays for public transport)

No insurance costs- my work also covers all insurance premiums. 

Grocery budget- $65 

Eating out including some lunch ($100-120 week)

Hovering around 700 credit score (high utilization average age of credit are the two biggest negative factors)

While not a math major, I know I am getting crushed with interest and it is piling up. I am able to put away (pay off debt of about $500-$1000 each month but it is not making a dent). I also recently incurred some terribly timed family emergencies that led to some expensive flights (but hey at least I got 3x points)



These are how I see my options:

1. Continue to chip away at the mountain of CC bills
2. Get a personal loan. Is this my best option? (I have shopped around and received offers around 11-13% ) [i.e. from MARCUS  72 month about $500/month @ 11.99%. Compares favorably to the 22% APR on the CC's.
3. Buy lotto tickets /s

Please let me know your thoughts and if you have any advice with what I can do. I envision that my salary will increase in the next couple of years. I also do not want to wreck my credit score.



TL;DR: Thought I'd get a job, didn't for 10 months. Lived off credit cards and don't know what to do to pay them off. Please help!



Thank you

&lt;p&gt;CC debt 15K&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;student loans: 150K (payment will soon start around 500-600/month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No transportation costs (work pays for public transport)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No insurance costs- my work also covers all insurance premiums. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grocery budget- $65 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating out including some lunch ($100-120 week)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hovering around 700 credit score (high utilization average age of credit are the two biggest negative factors)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a math major, I know I am getting crushed with interest and it is piling up. I am able to put away (pay off debt of about $500-$1000 each month but it is not making a dent). I also recently incurred some terribly timed family emergencies that led to some expensive flights (but hey at least I got 3x points)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are how I see my options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to chip away at the mountain of CC bills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a personal loan. Is this my best option? (I have shopped around and received offers around 11-13% ) [i.e. from MARCUS  72 month about $500/month @ 11.99%. Compares favorably to the 22% APR on the CC&amp;#39;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy lotto tickets /s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know your thoughts and if you have any advice with what I can do. I envision that my salary will increase in the next couple of years. I also do not want to wreck my credit score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Thought I&amp;#39;d get a job, didn&amp;#39;t for 10 months. Lived off credit cards and don&amp;#39;t know what to do to pay them off. Please help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm soon moving to Dublin for a new job. I am not from Ireland originally, but another EU country where I am a citizen and where I file taxes (since I have never ""unsubscribed"" from their register and technically I am still a resident there). I have no issues unregistering once I started my new job and become a permanent Irish resident. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to stay in Dublin for at least a year, but I do have some plan on moving to the US between 1 &amp; 2 years after moving to Dublin.

&amp;#x200B;

i want to live by myself and rent goes for about 1500 euros for a decent place by myself. So I was considering actually buying a place since I have quite some savings. This would be my first property. 

&amp;#x200B;

**About the $$**

My salary will be around 70k euros yearly, 

I have around 80k money in savings (everything on a savings account)

My parents are going to help me financially, I am not sure how much though. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

\- With my financials, is it a good idea to invest in an apartment in Dublin?

\- Around which amount should I look for a place? 

\- How much savings should me/my parents put into the down payment for it to be the best investment?

\- Does anyone have knowledge about the housing market in Dublin and what the trends are?

Thanks ahead for the help.  

&amp;#x200B;

A little background on myself: 24 y/o first generation college graduate making $80,000 salary living in Seattle. I've been working full time since I was 21. I don't really know what I'm doing when it comes to money management, although I'm not totally a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

First things first: I have read through some of the sidebar and have crafted some specific questions. I know the first step of the flowchart is to create a budget to track income and expenses, but I don't know what it is, I'm lazy AF and really really don't want to do that. I think I'm doing okay just winging it so I'd like to avoid that if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, onto my questions. Currently I'm putting 10% of my income into my employer sponsored 401k. I think I have all the funds invested into a target retirement date fund designed for retiring @ 65 y/o. I may change this, as I would like to retire early. I am also maxing out my HSA contributions. My employer only matches up to 6% for the 401k so I know I should be putting the extra money into an IRA. So that brings me to my first question: traditional or Roth? I have read the FAQ on it and I am leaning toward traditional? I am a high tax bracket being single with a high(?) income. I plan on being in a lower tax bracket in the future. I plan on living in Washington forever (so no state income tax). Would this be the correct approach? How much should/can I put into there? 

&amp;#x200B;

My next question: I currently have 25K ""emergency fund"" in a high-interest savings account with Ally. Should I be doing something else with this money, such as a CD? Since I don't really track my expenses very well, I'm not totally sure what 6 months of expenses is, but I'm sure 25K is more than enough. I actually had done a simple budget a while back and I think 6 months of expenses was around 13k, so should I take the excess and open a CD?

&amp;#x200B;

My last question (for now) - I currently have a 30 year fixed rate FHA mortgage @ 4.125%. I opened this in April 2016 with 3.5% down and have been making the payments since then, but have not made any additional payments. According to the Zillow estimate for my condo (I know those are not completely accurate), my remaining balance of the loan is about 60% of the value of the home. Should I refinance the loan to get rid of PMI payments? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of this is probably stuff I can figure out if I did some more research, but as mentioned above I'm lazy AF so I greatly appreciate any and all advice I can get! Sometimes when things require a bit more effort on my part I just say fuck it and don't do anything about it. So as much direct advice I can get, the better. It's almost like I need someone to just tell me what to do. Help me Reddit! Thank you :-)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a bit of a pickle and looking for some guidance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a senior at a public uni. with less than 2k in debt (mismanaged my accounts my first semester of school and had to take out a subsidized loan. Not paying it back until I graduate because no interest is accruing right now.) I've managed to get an academic full ride. However, my university scholarship requires me to maintain at least 15 credit hours per semester. This university scholarship account for about 40% of my aid.

&amp;#x200B;

I am finishing a nursing degree that is only 12 credit hours per semester, have finished all of my general education requirements, and am now forced to take an extra 3 credits in order to maintain my academic scholarship. I've requested a waiver for my final year to reduce my credit hours to 12/semester without impacting my academic scholarship that was turned down, but an alternative was offered that would cover closer to 30-35% of my financial aid.

&amp;#x200B;

I receive about 4k per semester in a student refund because my scholarships exceed my student bill. Absolutely all of the money goes towards rent, utilities, food, gas, books, and other required nursing items that add up quickly. I occasionally enjoy a night out with my girlfriend (1x/2 weeks or so), but we both take pride on keeping our overhead low and are drawn towards low cost activities like visiting arboretums and such. In short, we are allergic to debt and try to avoid it at all costs (we both come from families with tremendous CC debt).

&amp;#x200B;

Nursing school can be very taxing, so taking a non-required 3 credit course on top of it all can be irking to say the least. My days are long at the hospital clinical hours, so it is hard to find a course that fits into my schedule well. I'm sacrificing sleep and potentially a competitive GPA for grad school to take an unnecessary class. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've crunched the numbers, and my alternative would require me to send back approx. 1k of my refund for the final two semesters if I dropped to 12 credits, leaving me with approx. 3k of expenses. Without breaking down absolutely every cost for you, I am left with about 150$ weekly after rent and utilities. That's an extremely tight budget when factoring in gas (1 hour commute to hospital clinicals), food, and nursing expenses that often come out of left field. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... my two options are to tough it out and maintain my 15 credit hour schedule or borrow money. I am not qualified to take out a subsidized loan because I receive a student refund, and taking out any loan at all may effect the private scholarships I get, as their are certain stipulations regarding them being disbursed to me if I am also getting loans. It gets really tricky, and it's not exactly monitored... like at all... but it is something that I am expected to report to my private scholarship committee. I don't exactly want to walk that line of not being 100% transparent especially when it comes to federally regulated aid (even though its private).

&amp;#x200B;

There are two more options, however. I have managed to put a good chunk of money i've earned thru summers away into long-term investment accounts (approx. 4k) and its not exactly easy to liquidate it. I really really really don't want to have to let go of these investments because of what I think they can return in the next 7-10 years... 

&amp;#x200B;

... So my last option it to talk with my brother and request that he lend me the money I think I will need. He is pretty well-off and has mainly provided for me financially, but after going off to college I began assuming responsibility over myself. My parents don't really have much to offer at the moment. I am just nervous of asking my brother for the money. It's likely that he'll gift me the money without any expectation of return, however, a part of me feels guilt from the fact that I have all of this money squared away in investments but I'm now asking for handouts. A majority of that 4k investment was made this summer, and I don't think I would have made it knowing that balancing my nursing classes by themselves would be difficult, let alone with another 3 credit class that takes up my time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked with my sister about it, and she feels that its irresponsible of me to have an investment account while I am now asking for money from my brother. I think it's best for me to ask for the loan, and stick to paying it back regardless of him needing the money or not. I know a couple grand over the next couple of semesters is pennies to him, but the principle of it is important. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was originally thinking of getting a house around $350k and putting as much money down to reduce my monthly payments but is that the best thing to do? Should i just put down 20% and keep 6 months of emergency funds in a savings account and invest the rest? Houses right now are so expensive  and interest rates are about 4.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom will be moving in with me until i am more stable. She can pay most of the mortgage, i&amp;#39;ll probably just have to pay about $500 a month and she can take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, i&amp;#39;m self employee so my income is not the most stable. In the worst case scenario that I have no income next year, would it be better if i were to have a lot of money in my savings (even though id be paying high interest) , or that my mortgage is really low that working at a fast food restaurant would be able to pay for it? Because if i invest it, i don&amp;#39;t think i would safely be able to get 5%+ returns right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if the housing market were to crash, would having that savings be better? Or would it be better if my mortgage was low?&lt;/p&gt;

I've always been wary of taking out a loan or getting a credit card (so far I've avoided doing either in my life) after the Equifax leak, as apparently whenever someone applies for a loan or CC, your credit score is checked, which then forever stores your most personal information within the databases of the 'Big 3' credit check mega corps. 

Knowing how weak their security is for such sensitive information, I've recently been looking into the possibility of getting a credit card **without** a credit check being done, in an effort to negate the risk of future identity theft, and discovered that Pre-paid refillable credit cards exist (generally for low-income people with terrible credit scores).

Since I only plan on using a Credit card as a safer Debit card anyway, this would seem to be ideal for me. However, there's a plethora of pre-paid CCs to choose from with their own set of fees, and I was curious if anyone here knew more about them, and more specifically; which ones to avoid or recommend.

the Walmart CC seems to have the least amount of fees associated with it, but I've read some people losing access to their accounts for up to a couple weeks seemingly at random, which makes me hesitant to apply for one...

FIRE Progress: I am absolutely nowhere. I have no idea where to begin but I know my current spending and way of line is not sustainable. I'd really like to get better with my money and eventually have financial Independence.

Gross Salary/Wages: currently on unemployment ($364 a week) but my last job was $25/hour and my current prospects have me looking at anywhere from $50-60K/year. I've only made about $25-30K this year from my jobs but I'm hoping that changes when I find steady work. My job prospects are good as I'm a Business Analyst - I just haven't been able to find steady work.

Yearly Savings Amounts: I don't have any savings but i have been looking into IRA. The contracts that I have been working under don't match for a 401K. What I have heard is that if the employer isn't matching then it isn't worth it. I've heard it's better to put your money somewhere else but I don't really know and I'm looking for advice for when I start working I know what to do.

Maintenance/Gas: $70 
Food: $200
Phone: $93 (that's for me and my girlfriend) 
Medical expenses: 0 but that'll change when I'm working, I'm on medicaid

Assets: None

Liabilities: 
Student Loans: Stafford Loan $45,731.22 (actually 2 loans - $23,573.56 @ 5.590% fixed and $22,157.65 @ 5.060% fixed) Graduate plus loan $10,025.40 @ 6.06% fixed 

Credit card debt: Currently sitting at about ~$1,500, mostly due to being unemployed and living off of my credit cards.

I plan on retiring early, somewhere around 40, which my calculations seem to be supportive of (depending on how life goes).

The ""Before Social Security"" will last from when I start retirement up until I start collecting social security (so from around ages 40-65). Here I plan on living off of the Traditional 401(k) withdrawals since this will be the only income I will have during this time period. This way I don't have to worry about taxes as much since I'll have control over how much I'll be withdrawing, and I'll more than likely be in a lower tax bracket anyway.

The ""After Social Security"" will last from when I start collecting social security up to however long I live (so from ages 65-???). Here I plan on living off of both the Roth IRA withdrawals and Social Security. The benefit I see about using Roth IRA withdrawals here is that my Social Security income will not be taxed (in fact, I don't even think I'll be paying income taxes at all during this time period if I plan it out right).

The HSA will just be used for qualified medical expenses and also as a back up just in case I manage to run out of money before passing away.

It goes on to say that some portions might be tax-free if: 

&gt;You're a candidate for a degree at an educational institution that maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at the place where it carries on its educational activities; 

&gt;and
The amounts you receive are used to pay for tuition and fees required for enrollment or attendance at the educational institution, or for fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for courses at the educational institution.

I know that the portion I spend on fees/books is deductible, my question mainly concerns the remainder.  This seems to imply that the remainder is taxable *if* I'm not a degree candidate.  However, they go on to list stipulations for when it's taxable:

&gt;Amounts used for incidental expenses, such as room and board, travel, and optional equipment.

&gt;Amounts received as payments for teaching, research, or other services required as a condition for receiving the scholarship or fellowship grant. However, you don't need to include in gross income any amounts you receive for services that are required by the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program or the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program.

The first will apply to me, as I have rent I'm paying.  The latter will not, as I don't have work requirements.  This seems to suggest that my rent * 12 is what's taxable..my girlfriend and I are splitting costs, with me paying the rent and her paying most of the smaller things like groceries/internet.  Does this mean that I should swap roles with her and have her pay the rent and me pay the smaller fees, so that I decrease that amount spent on rent from 8400 to 0 by instead spending that ~$8400 on groceries/smaller bills? Either way, am I correct in understanding that the taxable portion for me is then:

annual amount spent on rent - amount spent on tuition fees&amp;books?

I'm trying to figure this out on my own but resources are somewhat limited.  I'd appreciate the help if anyone could provide a little guidance/clarification.

edit: Would just giving the money to my GF to pay for the rent and then having her pay it be a *loophole* or would it be *fraud*?  I want to minimize taxes, but I don't want to break the law.

[Financial Aid](http://www.finaid.org/savings/taxbenefitcoordination.phtml) has some information (seemingly pulled from the same source as the IRS info):

&gt;A scholarship or fellowship is tax free only if you meet the following conditions:

You are a candidate for a degree at an eligible educational institution.
You use the scholarship or fellowship to pay qualified education expenses.

This seems to more explicitly state that the remainder is not tax free, but it also goes on to mention the Room&amp;Board stipulation again.  Maybe that stipulation does not come into play until I'm a degree candidate and the remainder is indeed taxable..Once I become a PhD candidate, though my questions regarding switching rent payment to my girlfriend remain, though.  Also remaining is the question of whether or not I'm considered a master's candidate currently in any meaningful way.

[Harvard's site](https://oc.finance.harvard.edu/files/controller/files/hy_fellowship_payments.pdf) elaborates:

&gt;Fellowship amounts are nontaxable where:  The recipient is an individual, who is a candidate for a degree at an
educational organization such as Harvard University (i.e., undergraduates
or graduate students, but not post docs)

This makes me again then think that I am indeed a degree candidate, and so should be concerned about the rent stipulation.  I'm so confused.

Hi,

Thank you very much for reading.

First time property buyer. I want to be close to/in a trendy area thus targeting a condo/townhome (&lt;20 yrs old to keep maintenance costs low). Ideally I would eventually rent it out once I get married(3-5 years) and buy a house with the combined incomes.

How much can I afford without stretching myself too much, be able to continue to save for the future and possibly use it as an investment property? I am a believer in balancing an enjoyable lifestyle while keeping a solid plan for the future. I have read the wiki's here and used some calculators but I want a more personalized and human opinion. My current estimate for max price is $350,000 and monthly nut(mortgage, tax, HOA, PMI) max to be $2800. Am I already too high? Do I have room to go higher?

**Income**

$110k salary (will be similar for another year or 2 then go up to 130-150 in 3-5 years)

**Debt**

$75,000 in savings

$223,000 in IRA

$13,000 in Roth IRA

$3,000 in 401k

**Monthly**

$7400 monthly income after tax

\-$2000 in expenses (rent, car, food, entertainment, health/hygiene, etc)

\-$3600 to 401k (was unemployed most the year so trying to catch-up to max out the year, once I purchase house will

&lt;p&gt;I went through a move about 9 months ago and lost two of the checks I had yet to give her, along with some bills for various other medical expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check my credit report fairly regularly with credit karma, and the $500 collections from her popped up on my report. I called her office and payed her (not the collections agency), and I still need to reorder the checks from the insurance company. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm 31 years old, recently completed grad school, and have started my first job in a new, and hopefully lucrative career path. This is my first 401k and I need some advice.

My employer will match up to 4% which would activate when I contribute 5% of my income, so that's my plan. 
I make 55k currently but anticipate six figures within 6-8 years. 

I've read the 401K FAQ but would love your take on what my best option currently would be.

Also, I have a free Schwab Brokerage account (got it because I wanted their checking). My employer 401K options are through Fidelity. If I wanted to also contribute to an IRA, would there be an advantage of doing either Fidelity or Schwab? Would I want Schwab to handle my 401k...is that even possible?

Wondering how people generally structure savings in a way that will grow at a decent rate (better than savings accounts).  Let's say, hypothetically, I amass more than enough for the short term (emergency and whatever else I can anticipate in the near future).  What are good investment vehicles that provide high liquidity for the emergency / short term savings, and what can I reasonably use for mid and long term savings that still offer a bit of liquidity in case something else comes up?

What do you all use?  CDs, bonds, stock (prob not?), mutual funds, etc?  Open to advice on both types of investments and companies that offer access to those investments.  I should add that I live in the US.

EDIT:
I feel like some more info is appropriate:

- In my early 30s

- I already have a Roth IRA and am making the yearly contribution max as well as employer sponsored 401k contribution match

- I'm anticipating grad school in the next few years, so I feel like I should develop a fairly sizable savings for that time (6 year program - Ph.D.), and when I say short, mid, and long, I suppose I'm thinking short = about a year of living for grad school, mid = the following 3-5 years, and long = 6 - after grad school finding a job, etc.  I'll get pay in grad school, but it's not much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey PF,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm in massive debt. I'll do the best I can to explain the situation, but I'm really feeling helpless here and not seeing a way out of this dark hole I've dug myself. I know exactly what got me into this situation, but I need help getting out...
So last year the love of my life left me after four years (I'm in my 30s). Being so utterly distraught and feeling destroyed, I did what any insane person would do - I had my midlife crisis a little early. The job I contracted at ended in December 2017, contract ran out of money, wasn't by choice. So I stupidly believed chasing my dreams was worth a shot. I bought a very expensive RV for around $80,000. I travelled the country for 3 short months before realizing my grave mistake. I came back to my senses only to slip in to deep depression, knowing it was going to be impossible to get out. I quit my career to use marijuana medically and now that has absolutely killed any chance of the income I was previously earning.
So here's a real break down of my situation:
*Income:
*Disability check: $1,365/month
*Part-time catering job: $280/month
*Other income (DoorDash, Uber/Lyft, etc.): varies but usually around $600/ month
*Total: $2,245
*Monthly Debt:
*Rent: $400
*RV payment: $672 (at 7% interest 😭)
*Car payment: $266
*Car insurance for both vehicles: $ 146
*Cellphone: $100
*Gas: $100
*Groceries: $280
*Other debt owed:
*Back taxes: $5,000+ (see below)
*CC: $3,000
*Student loans: $45,000 (currently in deferment but I only have ONE class left before I have to pay again)
My two most major issues are the back taxes I owe from when I was contracting and this RV. I've gotten so overwhelmed with everything that I don't even know where to start. Last year was my first time being an individual contractor. I had no idea I had to pay taxes quarterly. I also didn't understand that I have to pay both mine AND my employer's portions of social security and whatnot. Hard lesson learned, but I didn't ever save for their portion because I didn't know. So where do I start to let the IRS know that I can't pay what they originally asked? I don't make the same income and I'll never be able to pay them with what I make right now...
Now the RV. I bought it brand new Jan 2018. I know this was dumb, I've beat myself stupid over it already. It's had a lot of issues keeping a charge with the battery. It's failed four times now to keep a charge and several batteries have been put into the vehicle. I keep telling the manufacturer that there is obviously a parasitic draw somewhere...whatever. They keep blaming the consumer saying I don't drive it enough or start it up enough. I start it up at least once every 2 weeks and I drove it for 3 months straight everyday. Since it's been so many times I'm considering suing under my state's Lemon Law. I've had it up for sale, but with it being so new, no one wants to pay that much since it isn't at a dealer. I don't know how to get out from under this thing...or the rest of this debt...
Any help at all is appreciated. I can provide more info if necessary. I'm sure there's something I forgot in here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guys, I&amp;#39;m not seeing much of a way out here. I&amp;#39;m in massive debt. I&amp;#39;ll do the best I can to explain the situation, but I&amp;#39;m really feeling helpless here and not seeing a way out of this dark hole I&amp;#39;ve dug myself. I know exactly what got me into this situation, but I need help getting out...
So last year the love of my life left me after four years (I&amp;#39;m in my 30s). Being so utterly distraught and feeling destroyed, I did what any insane person would do - I had my midlife crisis a little early. The job I contracted at ended in December 2017, contract ran out of money, wasn&amp;#39;t by choice. So I stupidly believed chasing my dreams was worth a shot. I bought a very expensive RV for around $80,000. I travelled the country for 3 short months before realizing my grave mistake. I came back to my senses only to slip in to deep depression, knowing it was going to be impossible to get out. I quit my career to use marijuana medically and now that has absolutely killed any chance of the income I was previously earning.
So here&amp;#39;s a real break down of my situation:
*Income:
*Disability check: $1,365/month
*Part-time catering job: $280/month
*Other income (DoorDash, Uber/Lyft, etc.): varies but usually around $600/ month
*Total: $2,245
*Monthly Debt:
*Rent: $400
*RV payment: $672 (at 7% interest 😭)
*Car payment: $266
*Car insurance for both vehicles: $ 146
*Cellphone: $100
*Gas: $100
*Groceries: $280
*Other debt owed:
*Back taxes: $5,000+ (see below)

But here’s the context anyway

I turned 16 a few months ago and I just got a job. Obvs, this being my first job, I only earn minimum wage (12,5 CAD) and I work abt 8 hours a week. The main reason I got a job is because my parents decided that I was old enough to pay for my own food, clothes, school supplies, books, blah blah (ew, i dont like growing up). They still pay for school and my public transport card, and I live with them so I have no rent to worry abt.  I guess I spend about 40-50 CAD a week in total (school cafeteria food is oh so very cheap)

So now I have a bit of a surplus of money (I dont spend all that much and its not like I’m saving up to buy anything in particular), and I guess I could just leave it in my savings account? Am I supposed to save up for university? Do I have to worry about the 2% inflation everyone talks about? (I mean, probs not bcuz I make so little that it barely makes a difference... but still.) How much money do I have to save up for it to make a considerable difference when I turn 18? Is it even worth it to work more than 8 hours a week as secondary 5 student (which is senior in highschool, I think)?

Honestly, I don’t know the first thing abt personal finance, and I was hoping that maybe I could start young. I can’t really find basic financial advice on the internet targeted towards teens, so here I am, on reddit (also cuz I’m a bit burned out and lazy to do a full research aha oups)

Back story: I’ve recently come into $10,000. I’m 23 years old and my tentative plan is to buy a house in 3-4 years.

Does anyone have any advice on where I could put the majority of my newly acquired money which will earn me a good return in 3-4 years? While I’m not expert, I have done a lot of reading about CD’s, high yield savings, and funds.

I should note that I have already began planning for retirement: I contribute 5% (with 4% match to 401k) and have a Roth IRA opened up.

I recently found out that one my parents has a large amount of credit card debt, around $20,000 at very high interest rates, between 15%-20%. I have over $20,000 invested in a mutual fund. My parents and I talked and I want to pay off this debt for them. (They promised to pay me back, but that's not really a concern for me right now).   
The problem is that I'm not sure if me taking out a large amount of money of around $20,000, depositing that into my bank account and then paying off the credit card debt will cause any problems with the IRS. I have done some minimal research and I'm worried ""restructuring"" could apply and the IRS could seize all of the money. Are there any such worries that I should have, and what should I do to legally and with minimum hassle withdraw the money from the mutual fund and pay off the credit cards?

I have created a budget using the 1% rule: maintenance will cost about one percent of the property value per year. Since we’ll be paying $550-600k for the condo, my assumption has been we each need to deposit $250/month for a housing fund to put aside $6k/year. This will only cover repairs inside the condo, not HOA, taxes, expenses for a tiny lawn, etc. 
 
We know very few people who own condos, however I recently started asking what the condo owners were paying for maintenance and none of them said it was anywhere near $6k a year. All of them have similar sized condos as we are looking at (2 bed, 1 bath, 1000-1300 sq ft). My parents have a single family home in the burbs and they said they haven’t spent anywhere near $6k/year for maintenance either, although major costs over 30years  have included a new roof (10k) and water heaters/furnace ($3-5k). 
 
A couple of factors: 

Outside maintance: The condos in our area are in a normal sized single family house. I.e. a 2500 sq ft single family where each floor is made into a condo, so you have 2-3 owners per HOA. People we know who own in such situations said that your HOA cost doesn’t swing that much because you have to decide between the 1-2 other people in the house what maintenance to cover. So usually snow removal is just the job of each tenant or one person shovels the sidewalk for a reduced HOA. Lawn care is a very minor cost since you have 12 sq ft of lawn next to the house. Fixing things like the roof cost the same as a single family would pay but split between 3 households. 

Housing fund: when we buy we will have $20k in a separate account per the mortgage requirements, as they require you to have 6 months of mortgage in a different account at purchase time. We’ll have that plus a buffer for any home repairs that immediately come up after purchase. Both my partner and I have steady jobs, so I am not too worried about us needing to tap this fund.

I have a question about how carry forward works. 

My understanding is that if you max your pension contributions for this tax year you then get to go back three years ago and work forwards using those years allowances, so long as you earn enough in the current tax year to cover those contributions.

My earnings for those years are below 

2015/16 £60k
2016/17 £70k
2017/18 £120k
2018/19 £120k

If I pay in £40k gross this year, then am I right in thinking that a further £40k gross will go against 15/16, and the next £40k against 16/17 and so on?

Am I also right in thinking that I can only contribute £120k this year as that is my income, and therefore I can't use 17/18's allowance?

Last question, if I can't use 17/18's allowance is it then gone for ever, or could I carry it forward by contributing £80k gross in tax year 2019/20?

35-40k salary??? 

Roughly 28k in federal loans by graduation. Sub and unsub

Bad credit. 500's. 3K or so in debts

My goals are to get a Ford focus RS most likely used and move out. I've always had bad or nearly broken cars that have given me nothing but headaches so it's a big point. But I notice I could probably compromise here if I needed to. 

While staying at home would be cheap, for both my parents sanity and mine I should move. Ideally I'd like a place alone but in my city that would cost 1200 or more. Which Im aware cuts into the car budget. Willing to do roommates since I've never done that before. 

I also make some extra income as a photographer but it's just a few thousand a year. I'm sure first year teaching will consume most of my time.

I just want to make sure I am doing enough for retirement, I know I can do more at the cost of delaying somethings like buying a house. I would like to retire by 60 and be very comfortable.

The overview
Age: 27
Location: medium-high COL city.  
Monthly: Gross is 5.5k / Net 3.4k (66k /yr)
Retirement: company sponsored 401k, 13% with 6% full match. (currently 30k)
Savings: 26k in shitty savings account (i really need to transfer this to a high yield online account)

Debt:
Car Payment:  $350/month (initial 20k @2.49% , 60 month) 43 months left

Budget: 
Into Savings: 1.1k
Into Checking: 2.3k
Rent+Utilities : 950/month ( 1900 total, split with fiance)
Car+Insurance: 450/month
Gas: ~150/month
Food/entertainment: Varies, never spend full amount of what goes into checking though

 I am using my checking account also as my pseudo emergency fund.  It generally hovers around 5k after all monthly expenses.  Each month there is normally a difference of +$300 between what I put into my checking vs what I spend.  This helps pay for all of those ""one time payment"" events. (weddings, car maintenance, vacations etc.) Due to going to grad. school (M.s, in sciences) I have only been working for 2.5 years.  My combined bank accounts when graduating were probably under 3k, so I basically started from scratch here.  In the 2.5 years I have also been able to budget in some large one time expenses (Engagement ring 3k, euro vacation, new car (3k + trade in down payment)) without having to touch my savings account.  

With all that being said, I would like to make sure my retirement and savings rate are great since I got a late start to the job market.  I want to save more for my retirement if possible, but also I do have my wedding coming up which will end up costing about 15K, maybe a little more all said and done. (Fiance will be making 100K/yr by time of wedding). We would also like to be able to purchase a house in the next couple years which I believe will be very doable b/w both mine and my fiance's earnings. (house price near 400k most likely) I do not have a complete breakdown of her finances, however she will have no student loans by time of wedding, and most likely a small car payment as she has always leased in the past, and she is as frugal/responsible with her money as I am(or think I am). Also no kids for next ~5 years.

TL;DR Late to the game retirement wise, am I saving enough, should I save more / smarter?
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, just a quick financial check up if you all don&amp;#39;t mind as I am not the most financially savvy person! I just want to make sure I am doing enough for retirement, I know I can do more at the cost of delaying somethings like buying a house. I would like to retire by 60 and be very comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overview
Age: 27
Location: medium-high COL city.&lt;br/&gt;
Monthly: Gross is 5.5k / Net 3.4k (66k /yr)
Retirement: company sponsored 401k, 13% with 6% full match. (currently 30k)
Savings: 26k in shitty savings account (i really need to transfer this to a high yield online account)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt:
Car Payment:  $350/month (initial 20k @2.49% , 60 month) 43 months left&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget: 
Into Savings: 1.1k
Into Checking: 2.3k
Rent+Utilities : 950/month ( 1900 total, split with fiance)
Car+Insurance: 450/month
Gas: ~150/month
Food/entertainment: Varies, never spend full amount of what goes into checking though&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using my checking account also as my pseudo emergency fund.  It generally hovers around 5k after all monthly expenses.  Each month there is normally a difference of +$300 between what I put into my checking vs what I spend.  This helps pay for all of those &amp;quot;one time payment&amp;quot; events. (weddings, car maintenance, vacations etc.) Due to going to grad. school (M.s, in sciences) I have only been working for 2.5 years.  My combined bank accounts when graduating were probably under 3k, so I basically started from scratch here.  In the 2.5 years I have also been able to budget in some large one time expenses (Engagement ring 3k, euro vacation, new car (3k + trade in down payment)) without having to touch my savings account.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that being said, I would like to make sure my retirement and savings rate are great since I got a late start to the job market.  I want to save more for my retirement if possible, but also I do have my wedding coming up which will end up costing about 15K, maybe a little more all said and done. (Fiance will be making 100K/yr by time of wedding). We would also like to be able to purchase a house in the next couple years which I believe will be very doable b/w both mine and my fiance&amp;#39;s earnings. (house price near 400k most likely) I do not have a complete breakdown of her finances, however she will have no student loans by time of wedding, and most likely a small car payment as she has always leased in the past, and she is as frugal/responsible with her money as I am(or think I am). Also no kids for next ~5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

I just collected a significant amount (for me) of cash by selling a shares in a private company.

I have no debt to pay off and no need for the cash other adding to my retirement fund, which I won't touch for another 5 to 8 years.

I used the cash to purchase treasuries using my TreasuryDirect account to avoid commissions.  However, it bugs me that I am collecting an after-tax yield that is about 1.2 percent lower than current inflation.   

With this strategy, I should lose about 10 percent of the cash over the next 8 years.  I don't expect that yields on Treasuries will go up because the Fed policy is to ""inflate us out"" of our national debt by keeping rates low.

I have been reading and folks suggest two alternatives: blue chip stock with high dividend yields and munis.

However, I find these solutions too risky.  Stock valuations are sky high.  I could lose ten percent in the next month.  Munis are hard.   Diversification is required in munis, but mutual funds are expensive.  There are a few ETFs with fees below 10 bps, but their yield is about 2.2 percent and they are subject to interest rate risk with a duration of 5 or so years.

Big fan of /r/pf but don't think I've seen this exact question come up before.

I'm a 27 year old professional that just paid off his student loans (hurray!) and is starting to think about saving for a down payment on a house.  I'm in an expensive area (SoCal) and will likely remain because my family and SO's family are both in the area.  Plus I love it here.

I'm basing my target price at 600-700k which leaves me with a 120k+ goal for a traditional 20% down payment.  Yes there are fees and such on top of this and prices are likely to rise, but let's leave it at 120k for this scenario.  I'm in no rush and honestly expect a 5-10 year timeline and SO won't become spouse  or contribute until she graduates and begins her career in 2 years.  I'm currently happy with my retirement savings rate (15%+ going into 401k) and emergency fund (6mo).

I'm currently estimating a conservative savings rate of 1k/mo solo, but obviously hope to accelerate my savings rate by reducing expenses and investing.  Any bonuses or raises I get will be allocated here, but none are ever certain.

My real question:
**What is the best place to vehicle to store and invest this money?**

Until recently I thought my options were basically high yield savings account/cds (conservative) or brokerage account (variable risk), but my father mentioned that it's possible to withdraw not just contributions but also earnings (up to 10k based on my research) from an IRA account for a first time home purchase which seems to leave me a third option.

Are there any downsides to using an IRA for saving and investing a future down payment fund?  I do not currently contribute to an IRA since my 401k selection is adequate and has comparable fees so I don't really think there's any opportunity cost.  The money will otherwise be deposited in a taxable brokerage account or savings account depending on how risky I decide to be.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if this is a dumb question - I&amp;#39;ve tried googling stuff like this but I always wind up feeling like I don&amp;#39;t understand results I find - or I wind up with a calculator that asks me questions I don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

I live with my gf and we work together. We have 2 incomes where we get all the money we receive in one account and we separate it into categories.

So here are my expenses and I just want to be put in my place as of what I should do:

Goals: Pay all my debts before June 2019 (lease will be over) and save to travel for 1 month without working in a roadtrip to the U.S. 

INCOME (Monthly)
Me: $1440 
Her: $1840


EXPENSES:

* RENT: 1400 (lease is done in June)
* GAS: 200 
* GROCERIES: 400
* PET FOOD: 150 
* PHONE: 150 (I have a deal with my parents, I cannot lower this)
* CAR INSURANCE: 60
* ELECTRICITY: 50
* SPOTIFY: 17 (Family plan)
* INTERNET: 70
* NETFLIX: 11 (Family plan)
* MEDICINE: 100

Debts:

* TJ MAXX: 3640 (26% Interest)

* BANK LOAN: 1565 (11% Interest)

* BANK LOAN #2: 4000 (10% Interest)

* CAPITAL 1: 700 (30% Interest)

I would really appreciate it with some kind of help to know how to save, how to stop spending money wrong, anything that can help me stay on track...

I am currently doing side hustles (selling used things at the flea market, selling CBD candy, and trying out retail arbitrage as well) but everything I make from there goes to an account that is not linked to anything except savings. I am looking into a CD 18 month account to start putting this profit aside as well. I do not counted this in the income since its irregular. 

Thank you in advance for your help I can truly use this new change of lifestyle. 

TL;DR I would like to know how to stop living paycheck by paycheck with my current lifestyle but I am more than willing to change anything that I must change to achieve my goals of paying all my debts and saving for a road trip by June 2019.

I am going to move out into another country to study there. As I will be living alone for the first time, I want to create a budget. But even after reading the sidebar, I'm still unsure how.

I am given approximately (have to convert € to US-Dollars) 3400$ a month. About 940$ are my rent, but I have to pay that in a third currency.

And well, let's go through all my problems:

1) I have no idea what my ""income"" is, as the currencies flactuate, and depending on the day I receive it, it will be different. My solution would be to take something a bit below averarge, and adjust as the courses change. Anything that is left over because of this, would be somehow saved.

2) Then I would substract my rent, insurance, transportation costs, landline and phone bill. No big problems here yet.

3) Now, as I have never lived on my own, I don't know about other costs I need to consider. A rough idea would be: 

* Groceries and essentials. Not sure how much yet, I will probably aim my first two months at 200$, and then see how it worked out. I make it two months, as in my first month I will probably want to stock up on some things, that I will probably not buy ever again, or only rarely (emergency medicine, kitchen stuff I don't yet know that I need, etc.)

* Monthly budget for online/fun expenses (video games, subscriptions, random stuff that's not useful)? Maybe something like 70$, or 210$ but it's a budget for three months? Or is a better solution to say that this are savings, and I save 60$ to my Fun Fund, that I can then use for whatever I want?

* PC upgrades, maybe save 50$ a month, so I can upgrade my GPU and case some day. Or does that belong to the fun fund? Is it better to split these things up, or leave them in one group?

* A monthly fund for things that aren't essential, but are not just for fun. Let's say things like a dish racket, or an automatic vacuum? Not sure how to manage that though, maybe 3-month budgets here might be better?

* Going out money. And that's pretty much it, no more ideas.

4) The next problem is saving. As I have already stated, we are dealing with two currencies, neither of which are US-Dollar. I'm over 1000$ under my ""income"" this way. Maybe I have forgot important things, but it seems to me like I can save up quite a bit. I have no depts, but several questions arise: Which currency to save in? The one I get the money, or the one used where I study? I need to have bank accounts in both countries anyways, so I have the freedom of choice. 

5) What to do with the saved money? In the US, I would probably just invest into S&amp;P 500, but my banks don't have this avaible for purchase, and I have no idea what else to invest in, as all my financial knowledge comes from reddit.

My mom thinks we should put down a larger amount. If we do her suggested amount, that would still leave us with about 33k

After we buy the house, there are several things we'll be spending big chunks of money on:

* Rent + Utilities at current house for 2 months while getting new house ready - about 2k
* Installment of Laminate flooring at new house in living room, hallway, and dining room and vinyl in the kitchen and bathrooms. I don't have all of the measurements rough estimate 7k?? 8??
* Painting of interior: 2-3k?? (again no measurements)
* Not all, but lots of furniture (all furniture for guest bedroom, new dresser and bedrame for master, new couch, two armchairs, new dining chairs, several bookcases, possibly a new desk/chair, plus decorative items and smaller pieces I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH.

My mom thinks the 33k will still be enough to cover the above and have some left over, but it bothers me that I don't know exactly how much I'll be spending. My mom said she never had more than 5k in savings her entire homeowning life but really I'd prefer to have a little more than that.

We can pay down the mortgage without penalty but it will only effect the length of the mortgage not our monthly payments.

Any advice? What would you do? Any clue how I can get better at estimating some of this stuff? I'm overwhelmed!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are buying our first home and are currently putting down 20%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to decide whether it is smarter to put down more than this, or to keep it the way it is to have a larger amount of savings. With the 20% down we will have about 46k in total savings left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom thinks we should put down a larger amount. If we do her suggested amount, that would still leave us with about 33k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we buy the house, there are several things we&amp;#39;ll be spending big chunks of money on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent + Utilities at current house for 2 months while getting new house ready - about 2k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installment of Laminate flooring at new house in living room, hallway, and dining room and vinyl in the kitchen and bathrooms. I don&amp;#39;t have all of the measurements rough estimate 7k?? 8??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painting of interior: 2-3k?? (again no measurements)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all, but lots of furniture (all furniture for guest bedroom, new dresser and bedrame for master, new couch, two armchairs, new dining chairs, several bookcases, possibly a new desk/chair, plus decorative items and smaller pieces I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH.

In February of this year, I declared chapter 7 bankruptcy. I had a lot of CC debt and loans thanks to having to support myself/having no idea how to manage money/a relationship. Everything was written off, except my car. I kept my baby. It's a 2014 Smartcar, loan is sitting at around 7K right now, 24% APR.

I have an appointment on next Wednesday for an insurance adjuster to take a look at it. Sadly, I was an idiot and set my deductible to 2K.

I'm wondering what will be the best course of action if they total my car out when the adjuster looks at it. Should I let them total it and take it?

I'm in the face of being kicked out by the end of the week, and I need a lot of help on where to go next.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an 18 year old male living in Utah (near Salt Lake). My parents decided to kick me out recently, to which I can't place blame towards them. I started to write a long paragraph about backstory, but I realized it's not really anything that contributes, and more of me just venting. Me and my mom constantly fight, and she will regularly tell me to move out (my dad will quickly solve the situation every time). This time she says there is no way she is staying, so its me or her moving out. There really is no way I can see this being solved by talking to her or my dad, so I've come to terms with having to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently don't pay for housing or food, as my parents were kind enough to provide for me as long as I was paying for my schooling. They loaned me money for my car I bought in 2016, but I crashed it, and I owe them nearly $5000 in total. That is both car and past school semester fees, we created a contract saying I would pay them back at least $200 a month. I also am paying for a student loan at $380 every month. I start a new job this upcoming Monday (9/10/18), at an hourly wage of $15.25 an hour for 30-39 hours a week (I don't decide how many hours I receive in that range). I also have a second job (teaching tumbling), that I work Wednesday and Thursday nights, from which I get a biweekly check of around $160. I figure I can rake in around $2150 before taxes if all goes well (at worst). I am not sure what I would do for housing, but I can definitely sleep in my car (a Honda Element) until needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly estimated expenses I expect are:

\- Phone Bill: $60

\- Car Payment: $200

\- Food: $150 (I fast often, and can go \~20 days without food fairly easily to help cushion the first month)

\- Student Loan: $380

\- Housing: $800 (Again, I can sleep in my car if needed)

\- Gas: $200 (My job is 20 miles away)

\- Gym membership (showers, located at work): $10

&amp;#x200B;

These are all the current expenses I would be responsible for as far as I'm aware (please make me aware of any others I might potentially need, I'm afraid I'm being unrealistic).

&amp;#x200B;

The total is **$1790**. My income will be an expected **$2150**, is this a realistic expectation to set for myself? I currently only have $500 saved up, with a student loan payment of $380 due the 10th. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! I&amp;#39;m in the face of being kicked out by the end of the week, and I need a lot of help on where to go next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an 18 year old male living in Utah (near Salt Lake). My parents decided to kick me out recently, to which I can&amp;#39;t place blame towards them. I started to write a long paragraph about backstory, but I realized it&amp;#39;s not really anything that contributes, and more of me just venting. Me and my mom constantly fight, and she will regularly tell me to move out (my dad will quickly solve the situation every time). This time she says there is no way she is staying, so its me or her moving out. There really is no way I can see this being solved by talking to her or my dad, so I&amp;#39;ve come to terms with having to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently don&amp;#39;t pay for housing or food, as my parents were kind enough to provide for me as long as I was paying for my schooling. They loaned me money for my car I bought in 2016, but I crashed it, and I owe them nearly $5000 in total. That is both car and past school semester fees, we created a contract saying I would pay them back at least $200 a month. I also am paying for a student loan at $380 every month. I start a new job this upcoming Monday (9/10/18), at an hourly wage of $15.25 an hour for 30-39 hours a week (I don&amp;#39;t decide how many hours I receive in that range). I also have a second job (teaching tumbling), that I work Wednesday and Thursday nights, from which I get a biweekly check of around $160. I figure I can rake in around $2150 before taxes if all goes well (at worst). I am not sure what I would do for housing, but I can definitely sleep in my car (a Honda Element) until needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My monthly estimated expenses I expect are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Phone Bill: $60&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Car Payment: $200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Food: $150 (I fast often, and can go ~20 days without food fairly easily to help cushion the first month)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Student Loan: $380&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Housing: $800 (Again, I can sleep in my car if needed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Gas: $200 (My job is 20 miles away)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Gym membership (showers, located at work): $10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all the current expenses I would be responsible for as far as I&amp;#39;m aware (please make me aware of any others I might potentially need, I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;m being unrealistic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total is &lt;strong&gt;$1790&lt;/strong&gt;. My income will be an expected &lt;strong&gt;$2150&lt;/strong&gt;, is this a realistic expectation to set for myself? I currently only have $500 saved up, with a student loan payment of $380 due the 10th. &lt;/p&gt;

Here is my current layout of my finances: [Current Bills](https://imgur.com/a/VqtG9nT) **Note:** I forgot to divide the DirecTV and AT&amp;amp;T bills by 2 as I split it with my sister.

I have a 2017 Kia Forte. Payments are high because I traded in an ‘18 Chevy Volt which has $100 higher of payments. So this is as low as I can go. Friend near me doesn’t have a car and I see what he goes through just *trying* use use mass transit and he ends up spending more money on Uber’s than I would on a car payment + gas. I have thought over selling the car but it doesn’t work out financially.

I have eliminated all extra curricular payments (YouTube, Spotify, Hulu, etc.) except Amazon Prime as we use Amazon enough that the $120 payment is 100% worth the money.

I currently make $13.26/hr but I just finished my IT Degree and I’ve got a job prospect of $14/hr and another one at $18/hr (interviews are early next week). I will take $18/hr if I’m offered it BUT I’m going to assume I don’t so that I can plan for current pay or even $14/hr. I work full time (32-36/week) and I have $100 healthcare come out each check. Generally they range about $600-800 bi-weekly.

Right now, my student loans aren’t ‘due’ but i want to pay them down as much as possible within the next 6 months so that when they are due I don’t have as much to pay. They are at just over 3% interest and I owe $7800 right now.

Rest of my debt is credit cards.

Navy Federal (highest balance) is at $8200 at 16.74% interest.

Best Buy Credit Card (next highest and now closed) is at $4900 with $2k at 0% interest until May 2019 (will be fine paying it off by then). Other $2900 is 0% interest til June 2019 &amp;amp; another in December 2019.

Chase Credit Card is at $2800 at 14.74% interest

Amazon Credit Card is at $2000 at 20.99% interest

I have 2 Google Store Cards (both closed and at 0% interest for 24 months) one is at $1100 (this one should be paid off with a refund soon; should also have $50 credit) and the other is at $800 and my friend pays me $50/month for that phone. So it is free for me.

———————————————————————

I have a 4K check coming from selling my Chevy Volt (refund on insurance) plus a possible raise from a new job.

What I was thinking about doing is using the check to pay off the Chase &amp;amp; Amazon cards to free up ~$130 for the Navy Federal &amp;amp; Best Buy cards but friends and family think I should use it to pay down the Navy Federal Card instead.

I’m just not sure what is the best route and how I can get my bills to a lower rate that I can afford.... also, I won’t get approved for a loan to consolidate my bills. I checked. :(

I know in most cases this is a dumb question, and the response is an obvious yes. However my situation is a little different. I am a government employee (law enforcement) who gets 11 sick days a year on top of vacation days, I have banked over 20 weeks of sick leave.

I do have a LTD plan, which kicks in after 12 weeks of being disabled. This plan is super cheap ($5 a pay) and I will be keeping it.  Between our e-fund and my banked sick leave, should I ever become seriously disabled, we should  be fine for 12 weeks. (my husband is also a government employee, so very stable jobs).

The STD plan costs me $30 a pay ($780) a year, and my monthly coverage amount is $2800 (about 80% of my take home).

I also did the math and at 780 a year, and getting two months of benefits ($5600)- even if it took longer to conceive, I would still be ahead.

I see some benefit in keeping the coverage in the future (we are not planning another child), its nice to get that double dip to cover medical costs, if I would need ACL surgery or something else in the future. My job does not offer ""light duty"", so if I am injured or physically restricted in any way, I am not allowed to work and will burn sick leave.

My inclination and desire is to pro-rate my last rental check for the 5 days without even mentioning it to the rental agency, and let whatever contract the current homeowner has with the agency determine how they handle the situation without my involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

**For**:

* ~6 hours less drive time per week. Having classwork to do after work, this is useful to me.
* Nicer place, quality of life perks
* Able to walk home for lunch instead of eating out. Kind of a big one, because money spent on eating out for lunch makes up a big section of my budget.
* Simplifies the task of being more reliable and available at the new job
* Minor savings on gas and food would offset some of the rent increase
* A small personal loan would be easy to pay off and a low-risk way to increase the number of accounts factored into my credit score. My credit is good, but the calculators tell me I need to borrow more money. Go figure.
* Well within safe range for housing expenses with split rent. Still within safe range if something happens and I need to pay full rent.  

**Against**:

* Lengthens recovery time from recent expenses 
* I'll end up paying maybe $400 in interest
* I'll have less cash on hand when my girlfriend buys a house in May
* Because it will temporarily increase my DTI, credit score will get worse before getting better
* Moving is a pain
* Worse for retirement goals, which also need some catching up
* New job is new, which carries all of the risks to stability associated with that sort of thing. It is pretty perfect though, so I think there's only a small chance of anything going wrong vis-a-vis job security.
* Dave Ramsey would yell at me


Thoughts? Does the new salary wash out the risk? Do the quality-of-life benefits not offset the cost? Is this a scenario anyone has been in before? Does it still count as lifestyle creep if it would have been affordable on my old salary? Would really appreciate any input.  

Thank you!

The rest came through in-kind, which was an eye opener into how big a shit-show that actively managed retirement fund was.

My partner is set to receive somewhere between 25-30k in company stock. The first portion has already vested and the rest will vest through 2019. It’s currently set up that the firm (schwab) will sell the stocks to offset the tax burden as the stock vests. 

She also has a stock option that she can excise through 2027. If she excerised the entire stock option it would cost over $21000. The stock has climbed more than 50% from the stock option price so this seems like a good deal. But there are of course lots of rules about when she can sell the stocks that I do not fully understand 

Neither of us have ever been in this situation before. I have advised her to ignore the stock option and use the stocks that have vested to pay off her student loans (11k) or invest in her retirement (she is 30 and just started a 401k)

She is interested in using some of the money as a down payment for a house (we have over 15k saved but that barely covers our emergency fund if we buy a house) 

She also really believes in the company so she is interested in holding some of her stocks to sell way later in future.

My questions are: 

When should we sell the stocks that are currently vesting? As soon as possible so that we can diversify?

What are the pros/cons of excerising the stock options?  

How do you all feel about using the money for retirement vs student loans vs buying a home?

More details:

Food: -400

Cellphones: -100
Insurance: -100
Everything else: -1000 (this includes haircuts/dye, body products, clothes, travel, entertainment and lots of eating out)

Her student loans:  -175

Here's my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are amicably parting ways. I need to come up with a little over $40,000 to meet the requirements of what she and I had agreed. Originally I planned to finance this by selling the home I bought a year before we got married, pay all the student loan debt and her car off, then split what's left. I'm trying to find a way to keep the house though for a couple of big reasons: 1. I have a mostly blind Dog who does not adjust well to big moves, and I don't want to make her do it again. 2. I have an amazing loan currently locked in at 3.25% APR, and I'll never see a rate that good again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I need $40,000. I have come up with $15k using my savings, a loan from my 401k, and borrowing from family, leaving $25k needed. I owe $268,000 on my mortgage, and the value of the home is 370,000 give or take. HELOCs I have looked at will only go up to 70% of the value of the home, meaning I can't get one of those unless the appraisal came back unrealistically favorably.

I make $4750 a month after taxes. Mortgage is 1660. A liberal estimate of other necessary expenses and my current CC payoff plan (about 7500 in CC debt, all on a 0% interest deal for the next 14 months) total about $1800/ month. Paying off my family in a year as I promised will be $670 a month. That means I've got  only about $600 of wiggle room. However, after one year the 670 family payment drops off, and after 14 months the $550 to the credit cards drops off. 

I also have renters lined up to share the house with me at $1000/month rent plus half of utilities, probably adding a net $1250 to my budget, assuming that works out. I figure I'll need roommates anyway. 

The personal loan being offered by USAA would come in at 11.69% APR over 72 months with a payment of 475/month and no penalty for extra payments or paying early.

It seems to me that as long as I have renters for the first year, I should be fine okay. After that year, I can snowball those payments into the personal loan and have it paid off in about a year and a half, avoiding most of that interest. Is there anything that I am missing? Are there better options than this personal loan through my bank? 

Thanks PF.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. Here&amp;#39;s my situation.&lt;/p&gt;

My job pays about $48k and my necessary expenses are about 43% of my checks. The remaining is saved (for general savings &amp;  for car maintenance), and I do still eat out a couple times a week but nothing crazy.

Also, I already pay for health insurance through my work and contribute 3% to my 401k (they match up to 3%).

As stated I live with my dad and pay him rent and take care of all my personal expenses, including groceries, wifi, phone, car insurance, and my two Chase credit cards (with negligible balances). I know the financial advantage of living with my dad for a long time but I want to have my own place and my independence, so I don't see myself staying there longer than 3.5-4 years max.

My car is a 2006 Toyota Corolla that I own that doesn't have any major issues (I had to endure those expensive repairs when I bought it two years ago) and I don't plan on buying a new car. I will run this car into the ground or at least that's the plan.

I know that it's possible for me to rent an apartment right now but since I'm lucky enough to be in this situation I want to gun for the condo instead, because to my knowledge it's a better investment to own property and I know that it's a life goal of mine. **I would be buying this property with someone close to me who could pay their half**. It's not meant to be a ""forever home"" but instead a small entrance into the world of real estate to eventually inevitably sell for a bigger home down the line. 

Do you think that it's reasonable that I can purchase a condo in 3.5-4 years in this situation? What would your recommendations be? Do you think this is a good or bad idea? Would love to hear any comments, ideas, warnings or suggestions that anyone can give. Thanks for reading!!!

Shortly, however, my commute will be almost 40 miles each way (which will be like 90-120 minutes in rush hour).

Because of this, I think it's probably best to get a different car. I'm guesstimating I can get between 9k and 13k for my current car (I've never personally bought or sold a car before, though). I'm prepared to get a small loan to bridge a gap if I need to, but I'd rather avoid it if possible of course. 

I want to buy used. The only way I'd buy new is if the used price was too close to the new price (yet still in a reasonable range). I've managed to convince myself getting a super nice car is very irresponsible right now (because it is), so now I'm stuck choosing between more viable, practical options (though I'll be honest, I'm not fully certain where Lexus necessarily falls in this context). I'm thinking a reasonable budget is 9k-15k or so, ideally not borrowing more than 5k-6k max (I'm aware I'm unlikely to find anything new in that price range, which is fine). 

I think a Prius may be the best decision simply due to fuel economy. It has a relatively impressive list of features too, which is a plus.

I like sedans a lot more than hatchbacks, hence why the Civic and Camry are on the table, but assuming the aforementioned 3 are equally reliable, I'm not sure either of the sedans have much on the Prius (who has a slightly better fuel economy).

Lexus is potentially on the table atm because I need some educating. I know they have some ES hybrids that can run cheap-ish and, from what I've read, they tend to be as reliable as Toyotas. I don't know about the cost of maintenance, as I've heard they're cheaper to maintain than German cars and more expensive than Toyotas, but that scale still feels kind of ambiguous.

Approximately $3200 in monthly expenses currently.
Guestimating ~$5000/mo income post-tax. It could be a bit higher, though I'm not going to count on that. 

Thoughts? Advice? Experiences? Car recommendations are welcome too, though I know this sub is high on Toyotas.

Thank you in advance!

Edit: clarity ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I currently have a 2014 Mustang (just the basic model) that&amp;#39;s in good shape and have been commuting about 15-20 minutes. Shortly, however, my commute will be almost 40 miles each way (which will be like 90-120 minutes in rush hour).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I think it&amp;#39;s probably best to get a different car. I&amp;#39;m guesstimating I can get between 9k and 13k for my current car (I&amp;#39;ve never personally bought or sold a car before, though). I&amp;#39;m prepared to get a small loan to bridge a gap if I need to, but I&amp;#39;d rather avoid it if possible of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to buy used. The only way I&amp;#39;d buy new is if the used price was too close to the new price (yet still in a reasonable range). I&amp;#39;ve managed to convince myself getting a super nice car is very irresponsible right now (because it is), so now I&amp;#39;m stuck choosing between more viable, practical options (though I&amp;#39;ll be honest, I&amp;#39;m not fully certain where Lexus necessarily falls in this context). I&amp;#39;m thinking a reasonable budget is 9k-15k or so, ideally not borrowing more than 5k-6k max (I&amp;#39;m aware I&amp;#39;m unlikely to find anything new in that price range, which is fine). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a Prius may be the best decision simply due to fuel economy. It has a relatively impressive list of features too, which is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like sedans a lot more than hatchbacks, hence why the Civic and Camry are on the table, but assuming the aforementioned 3 are equally reliable, I&amp;#39;m not sure either of the sedans have much on the Prius (who has a slightly better fuel economy).&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I've done something against what most people have advised me. However, I've made it this far listening to my instinct and would like to lay out some thoughts and create a discussion on what I am doing with my *personal finance*

&amp;#x200B;

I live in California, next to a university. I put my house on the market, got a full offer. I've lived in the house for about 2.7 years and it has appreciated about 25%. I qualify as primary residence for 2 years, all profit through equity is tax free. I have found a rental home at 1850 a month, about 600 more than my mortgage + HOA + Taxes fees. The reason I think is this: house prices are going to crash within 2-3 years (if not sooner).

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have is, that's against popular opinion and I don't know how to communicate as well as I know how to type. Here is what I know about bubbles, you have the size of it and then you have the burst - two different events.

&amp;#x200B;

Size: Imagine my house, a real estate property, a certain percentage of the house is paid off, a certain percentage of the house is in loans. Think of the totality of all real estate, what percentage of it is paid off and what percentage of it is in loans. It sounds like a bubble forms when lending companies start running out of cash. The normal process of larger companies buying smaller company loans gets harder and rates start to go up.  Something in-ordinarily happened in the last two years, prices were skyrocketing and everyone who had plans to buy a home went out and bought homes with loans even if they had to pay 25k+ more than the asking price to do so. Where most of the assets were owned (either by the crash or houses paid off) - are selling their properties, evidence of this is rates are starting to go up.

&amp;#x200B;

The burst: A large bubble doesn't mean it's going to burst if the economy is going well. But like many of you have witness, we are heading towards a social instability. People forgot how to communicate with each other and a divide is happening. I see it on facebook, reddit, social sites, news, etc... people are uncertain. In the next two-three years, there is going to be a clash from the divide and many new homeowners are going to be affected and they may need to sell their property.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the topic of an in-ordinarily amount of increase in home prices. We've seen this bit coin, this happens in lots of different settings, when something in-ordinarily increases, it goes down and panic makes it go down faster. It was just unrealistic to be able to sell my house within a few days full price. Everyone is jumping this hype train, even my fiancees parents scrambled money across the family to buy a house (even though they shouldn't be able to afford it). People say it's much safer now, but I work in a large corporate environment and we have trouble understanding just within house, I do not believe a massive collaboration of many lending companies will be successful.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my plan. When you take the 600 a month I'm paying extra, plus principal I'm not paying in my original mortgage, I'm losing about 10K a year if I had just stayed in my house. If the house prices go down 10k a year on average, I will have made that up (more if you consider extra interest).

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done something against what most people have advised me. However, I&amp;#39;ve made it this far listening to my instinct and would like to lay out some thoughts and create a discussion on what I am doing with my &lt;em&gt;personal finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in California, next to a university. I put my house on the market, got a full offer. I&amp;#39;ve lived in the house for about 2.7 years and it has appreciated about 25%. I qualify as primary residence for 2 years, all profit through equity is tax free. I have found a rental home at 1850 a month, about 600 more than my mortgage + HOA + Taxes fees. The reason I think is this: house prices are going to crash within 2-3 years (if not sooner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is, that&amp;#39;s against popular opinion and I don&amp;#39;t know how to communicate as well as I know how to type. Here is what I know about bubbles, you have the size of it and then you have the burst - two different events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Size: Imagine my house, a real estate property, a certain percentage of the house is paid off, a certain percentage of the house is in loans. Think of the totality of all real estate, what percentage of it is paid off and what percentage of it is in loans. It sounds like a bubble forms when lending companies start running out of cash. The normal process of larger companies buying smaller company loans gets harder and rates start to go up.  Something in-ordinarily happened in the last two years, prices were skyrocketing and everyone who had plans to buy a home went out and bought homes with loans even if they had to pay 25k+ more than the asking price to do so. Where most of the assets were owned (either by the crash or houses paid off) - are selling their properties, evidence of this is rates are starting to go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burst: A large bubble doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to burst if the economy is going well. But like many of you have witness, we are heading towards a social instability. People forgot how to communicate with each other and a divide is happening. I see it on facebook, reddit, social sites, news, etc... people are uncertain. In the next two-three years, there is going to be a clash from the divide and many new homeowners are going to be affected and they may need to sell their property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the topic of an in-ordinarily amount of increase in home prices. We&amp;#39;ve seen this bit coin, this happens in lots of different settings, when something in-ordinarily increases, it goes down and panic makes it go down faster.

Early this summer I had ran into a mall about 10 minutes down 95 from my office to grab lunch. I’m sitting in my car blasting music and eating when this woman is yelling at my car window. She is holding a wallet with her bank card flush to the wallet for me to see. I roll down the window because I can be awkward.

I promptly roll up my window. She tries to say more but I ignore her... she never goes to the bank she just wanders to the next person to bother. 

Cut to this afternoon. I am parking outside my office and the SAME woman comes up and is yelling at my window. I had to get out of my car so I tell her instantly “I don’t have any cash”. She  tells me she’s not looking for cash. She then proceeds to tell me she left her car to take the Amtrak and came back to her car towed.

She is doing the same thing with her wallet and exposed bank card. I say I’m not from the area aggressively so she’ll leave me alone.

Me and my partner were looking into going on a cruise in January 2019 to celebrate my graduation, but finances may be a possible issue, so financing it came up in conversation. All of which lead to me realise I don't have any credit rating at all. I've only ever had a debit card, don't even have a phone bill in my name (purchased outright with cash and use prepaid). Because of this I was thinking it might be difficult to get approved for a credit card as well as future loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it would be a good idea for me to get a low limit credit card ($500) and use it for regular transactions, just like I would with my debit card, and pay it off immediately? Would this be beneficial? Any negatives that would come with the process?

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been told it might help to apply for a small personal loan (under $1,000), do a few payments, and then pay it all off in a lump sum ASAP, would this be beneficial as well?

Also, if you have any recommendations for credit cards (Australian) please let me know!

Long story short, I recently started get calls from a debt collector.  I'm normally very good with my paying my bills and stuff so I'm like WTF?!?

Turns out last year, I cancelled my Sprint plan to join my girlfriends phone plan.  I received a final bill in the amount of $400+ because they has not received my phone.  I returned my phone to a sprint store and had a confirmation number, just had to wait for the warehouse to receive the phone and they would adjust the bill.

Fast foward a month or two, I call them up and pay the final bill for something like $100 and something, whatever they told me was due.

Fast forward few more months, debt collector calling regarding $93 i owe to Sprint.  I've tried calling Sprint, they insist my final payment was not paid in full.  Why would i wait to make a final payment till they credited my phone, to not pay it in full?  

Anyway at this point I just want it removed from my credit report, my score has dropped and I'm looking at getting a consolidation loan soon and dont want any negative reports on it.

When i called the collections company listed on credit karma, they said I can pay the in Full or settle the debt for 60%.  Obviously i'd like to pay the least as possible to get this removed, does it make a difference if I settle?

TL;DR  Debt collector is giving me an option to settle debt for 60% of what is owed, but the account will be listed as ""Settled"" instead of ""Paid-in-Full"".  Is this bad?

I have 5 years of experience doing what I do, and 8 years of experience overall; and since I am so good at it I quickly grew from entry level 5 years ago to director in just 5 years. As a director I ran the department at the location I was at and had people under me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway in the past I have never had any problem finding a job. When I started looking for jobs prior to being hired for my most recent job I had 10 interview requests within a few days. For my most recent job, I interviewed 3 times, once in person after being flown in, and signed my offer within 10 days after sending in the application. My jobs before that were the same thing, didn't take too long and I had plenty of interview requests. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time around? Nothing. It's been 7 weeks and I've applied for, by my count, 274 jobs at this point and have only gotten 2 interview requests. Of those 2, I made it to the final round(2 phone interviews, 1 skype, 1 in person interview) before being extended an offer only for the hiring manager to get cold feet and withdraw it the next day for some reason. The other interview I made it to the 3rd round before being cut. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having no luck at all. The one thing different this time around is that I am out of work and I am guessing that is a red flag even though it had nothing to do with my job performance or behavior. And its not like I am only applying for jobs where I live - I'm literally applying for jobs all over the country. I'm applying for jobs equal to what I had been doing and even a step or two below, since I really need to get something soon before I run out of money. I'm doing part time work in the mean time to just keep me afloat.

My son got a burn on his hand that got infected about 10 days later. We took him to his pediatrician who wanted us to see a pediatric burn specialist. The pediatrician called our local Children's hospital and told us they were expecting us. We went to Children's hospital who did vitals, had a nurse look at his burn and after a few hours of waiting came to tell us the specialist had gone home. They talked to another hospital (a regular, non-pediatric hospital) which had a burn specialist we could see and sent us across town.

At the second hospital a nurse took vitals and we finally saw the specialist who said the burn was healed and left the room. The nurse came back, lanced and cleaned the infection and sent us home with an antibiotic script.

Today we received two ER bills. I am feeling frustrated because we would not have gone to Children's hospital had they told our pediatrician the specialist would be going home - we would have gone to the regular hospital instead.

I am a 19 year old student who is fairly new to investing. 

I am trying to fully understand the difference between Mutual Funds, ETF's and Index Funds.

So far I understand:

Mutual Funds typically have higher commission fees, are controlled by a portfolio manager at a financial institution and cannot be bought and sold throughout the day.

ETF's are similar to mutual funds but typically have lower commission fees, aren't managed by a portfolio manager and can be bought and sold throughout various periods in a day. 

My confusion lies with index funds.

I understand index funds are a collection of stocks/bonds that track an index or industry. I also understand the benefit of buying index funds as you further diversify your investments and are subject to the average growth of a particular index or industry.

Here is my question. Can ETF's and Mutual Funds both hold index funds? Is it possible to purchase mutual funds or ETF's that don't hold index funds? 

Thank you so much for your help and please feel free to correct me if I am incorrect in any of my current explanations regarding investment types. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to fully understand the difference between Mutual Funds, ETF&amp;#39;s and Index Funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual Funds typically have higher commission fees, are controlled by a portfolio manager at a financial institution and cannot be bought and sold throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETF&amp;#39;s are similar to mutual funds but typically have lower commission fees, aren&amp;#39;t managed by a portfolio manager and can be bought and sold throughout various periods in a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My confusion lies with index funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand index funds are a collection of stocks/bonds that track an index or industry. I also understand the benefit of buying index funds as you further diversify your investments and are subject to the average growth of a particular index or industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my question. Can ETF&amp;#39;s and Mutual Funds both hold index funds? Is it possible to purchase mutual funds or ETF&amp;#39;s that don&amp;#39;t hold index funds? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your help and please feel free to correct me if I am incorrect in any of my current explanations regarding investment types. &lt;/p&gt;

   I've read many posts about car purchases, and I've learned a lot of great things. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer here, but I need you guys to help me be objective with this car purchase. I'm using a throwaway because I don't want my financial info on my main account. 

   So I'm debating between a new or used Subaru Crosstrek. The used one I've found is a '15 with 42k miles, asking $20,995. It drives great, the color's not my favorite, and it is at the dealership where I take my current car in for service. Anything else in town or within 200 miles is about the same price, and it's reasonable according to KBB and TCV. 

   New '19 Crosstrek in a better color is $25,800 MSRP.

   I make \~$2000/mo. $320 goes into retirement (IRA and 401K), let's say another \~$1300 for bills and food. That leaves \~$400 in my account after all expenditures. I have $4000-5000 for a down payment. I want to keep my payments around $300/mo. I am eligible for a 2.49% rate at a 60mo. loan.

   I like my current service guys and want to stay with them. I had the 'lifetime oil change' with my current car that I bought in '09, so I'd like to do it again as I feel it's a good deal. I also would like to get tires there (they typically have buy 3 get 1 free and they'll rotate them for free). 

   I guess I should also note that there is currently nothing wrong with my car. I love it but am unable to access certain areas due to the lack of ground clearance and AWD. I have no 'need' to purchase a car at this moment, besides the 'need' to get to these places for hiking/hunting/farting around in the woods.

   Questions:  
1) should I get the used one that's (before negotiating) $6k less?  
2) should I wait a few months and save more $$ for a larger down, like $7k, and get new?

3) is it stupid to take my new Subaru to a Toyota dealer and purchase the 'lifetime oil' from them and get my regular maintenance done there? I've not heard great things about customer service at the local Subaru dealer (both in the sales and the service departments). The next closest Subaru dealership is 1 1/2 hours away so it's not like I can go to another Subaru dealership to get maintenance done, and their Crosstrek supply is like 4-5 cars so I do think I'll get any better deal.

4) is there any way to talk down a new car with an MSRP at $25,800 down to like $23k? I've not negotiated for a car in 9 years.

Sorry it's gotten very long. I've tried to minimize unnecessary info while providing what I think ya'll need so you can tell me your opinions. Thanks so much and I eagerly await replies!

You would configure your bank's email settings to notify you of every transaction to a @bankity.com email which you would create in-app and it would in turn forward the info. to your personal email. It would read the amount of the expense and merchant/business from the email and log them in the app automatically. It would even try and guess a category for the expense, entertainment, shopping, health, etc.

This app has become increasingly unreliable as the startup has pivoted and focused their strategy on creating a credit card linked to the app, and the activity log is not registering some transactions, making the whole budget overview of your expenses incomplete.

&lt;p&gt;For a while I&amp;#39;ve been using Bankity, which had a clever workaround. You would configure your bank&amp;#39;s email settings to notify you of every transaction to a @bankity.com email which you would create in-app and it would in turn forward the info. to your personal email. It would read the amount of the expense and merchant/business from the email and log them in the app automatically. It would even try and guess a category for the expense, entertainment, shopping, health, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app has become increasingly unreliable as the startup has pivoted and focused their strategy on creating a credit card linked to the app, and the activity log is not registering some transactions, making the whole budget overview of your expenses incomplete. I can no longer make decisions based on this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any ideas let me know, I&amp;#39;ve tried to enter expenses manually but I just can&amp;#39;t. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I promised myself I'd never get into this mess- but I'm in it, and I need help getting out.  


I have $8,900 in CC debt and approx. $6k remaining on a private loan. All in all, about 15k in debt. interest rates on the cards are around 29%, the loan is about 12%. I can only afford minimum payments for an indefinite amount of time- so the total amount on those debts isn't getting any lower and those minimum payment amounts are slowly climbing...   


My question is- should I refinance and consolidate this debt? My idea is that if we're paying about $300/month in minimum payments, and our mortgage (including insurance/taxes) is about $650, even if our mortgage payment went up to as much as $750, we'd still be saving $200/month.  


My current mortgage principal balance is about 85k, and my home value has gone up since we've purchased it. It's around 110k according to all the free estimates (obviously the appraisal will determine the accurate amount). So I might have a tiny bit of equity I can work with to pay off that debt... I could also theoretically switch from FHA to Conventional and get rid of PMI.  


The problem is that my current mortgage rate is SOOO nice- it's 3.2%. Current mortgage rates for a 30 year fixed are about 4.5%.   


Would I be saving money by consolidating this debt into my mortgage? Or losing money?  


I have an appointment to talk to a banker on Monday, but I want to be prepared- I don't want to sign up for something that looks good on paper but is going to kill me in the long run.  


&amp;#x200B;

Any advise is greatly appreciated.

I can only afford minimum payments for an indefinite amount of time- so the total amount on those debts isn&amp;#39;t getting any lower and those minimum payment amounts are slowly climbing...   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is- should I refinance and consolidate this debt? My idea is that if we&amp;#39;re paying about $300/month in minimum payments, and our mortgage (including insurance/taxes) is about $650, even if our mortgage payment went up to as much as $750, we&amp;#39;d still be saving $200/month.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current mortgage principal balance is about 85k, and my home value has gone up since we&amp;#39;ve purchased it. It&amp;#39;s around 110k according to all the free estimates (obviously the appraisal will determine the accurate amount). So I might have a tiny bit of equity I can work with to pay off that debt... I could also theoretically switch from FHA to Conventional and get rid of PMI.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that my current mortgage rate is SOOO nice- it&amp;#39;s 3.2%. Current mortgage rates for a 30 year fixed are about 4.5%.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I be saving money by consolidating this debt into my mortgage? Or losing money?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an appointment to talk to a banker on Monday, but I want to be prepared- I don&amp;#39;t want to sign up for something that looks good on paper but is going to kill me in the long run.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advise is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks! &lt;/p&gt;

Hello /r/personalfinance!  The moderation team would like to update everyone on a few things, answer any questions, and listen to your feedback.

# We're looking for new moderators!

If you're either a frequent participant on /r/personalfinance or an experienced moderator, please consider applying. You can [submit an application here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8LbTelraVgP0ZW3G1jvpRAcrrjqd7JTEUZJCMk41XRM_r6A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

# The wiki

Since our last meta post, we've added some new pages:

  - [Death of a Loved One](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/death_of_loved_one)
  - [Banks and Credit Unions](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/revisions/banks_and_credit_unions)
  - [Long-Term Care and Disability Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance)
  - [Cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/cryptocurrency)
  - [Self-Employment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/self_employment)
  - [Scams and Frauds](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/scams)
  - [Umbrella Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance)

We've also continue to maintain the entire wiki and updated pages including: [Reading List](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/readinglist), [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), [Investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing), and [Roth or Traditional](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional).

Think something is missing and willing to write it?  Let us know!

# Rules changes

We haven't changed the rules significantly since our last major update when success stories and victory posts started being redirected to the weekend thread, but we have made a few clarifications to the rules including:

- Rule 2: In addition to not allowing accounts that are named in a way to promote or advertise (e.g., ""xyz_blog""), we now also disallow accounts with promotional user profile pages.  Some promotional accounts trying to work around rule 2 started doing this shortly after the new user profile pages were made available.

- Rule 6: Petitions are explicitly disallowed now.

- Rule 8: Stripping and camming suggestions are explicitly disallowed now.

- Rule 9: Medical advice is disallowed now. It's fine to tell someone ""You need to go to a doctor"" or whatever, but a small minority of people loudly advocating and pushing for specific treatments has become a bit of a problem on posts related to health care.

- Rule 9: Job and school selection questions (e.g., ""which offer should I take?"")

  &gt; Edit: We've heard the feedback on the ""Job and school selection"" rule and we're going to revise the rule phrasing to be much more narrow or maybe entirely remove the rule (rule 1 arguably covers the rare removals that happen under this rule). **Please don't forget to comment on the rest of this post!**

# How should we handle success stories?

We're thinking about allowing success stories to be posted on the weekday thread rather than just the weekend thread so that people who have a victory post removed are able to immediately repost.  What do you think?

# 30-Day Challenge Series

If you haven't stopped by our 30-day challenge series lately, please [check it out](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges). If you have any suggestions for topics you would like to see us cover *and* you're willing to write it up, please let us know.

# Advertisements

One of the core principles that's very important to us is that we want to keep PF as free as possible from advertising, soliciting, and other shenanigans to make money off of the subreddit. Over time, we've had to make the subreddit rules increasingly strict (e.g., disallowing PM requests) because certain people have come up with progressively more creative ways to work around the rules.

Simply put, we want advice to be given without conflicts of interest and because people want to help others, not because it financially benefits the person giving the advice.

Of course, Reddit runs advertisements that run on /r/personalfinance, and that hasn't been an issue as long as those advertisements are clearly advertisements and don't look like normal posts, and we absolutely want Reddit to be successful as a company.

The moderation team would like to ask everyone for some help. Specifically:

1. When you run into a comment or submission that breaks the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/about/rules), please report it to the moderation team.

2. If you run into a problematic paid advertisements running on /r/personalfinance, please send us modmail so we can report them to the admins.  To be specific, the [Reddit advertising policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibits products or services that:
  - **facilitate illegal, fraudulent, or misleading behavior**
  - are related to **unsubstantiated financial products and services, investment, or contribution strategies and schemes**
  - are any of the following:
     - **Single securities or other tradable financial assets**
     - **Payday loans**
     - **Debt assistance programs**
     - **Get rich quick schemes**
     - **Pyramid schemes and multi-level marketing**
     - **Penny auctions**
     - **Binary options**
     - **Cryptocurrency wallets**
     - **Unaccredited digital banks that perform any traditional bank-like functions**
     - **Cryptocurrency credit or debit cards**
     - **Initial coin offerings, token sales, or other means of promotion or advertisement of individual digital currencies or tokens.**

3. If you're using the redesign and you find it difficult to discern that a submission is a sponsored post, please let the admins know how you feel about that.

# Any other feedback or questions for the moderation team?

Are there any changes or improvements would you like to see?  Are there things we could be doing differently or better?

I know exactly how I got here. Unemployment + medical bills will (God willing) not be an issue going forward.

Bottom line up front: My cash flow is totally maxed. Trying to decide on a temporary solution. Income is good but I CAN NOT catch a break (car repairs, medical bills, etc).
Non-negotiable expenses (Day care, utilities, car payment, etc): roughly 50% of monthly income.
Possibly (temporarily) Negotiable expenses (Mortgage, Credit card payments, food): Mortgage ~$1100. 7 credit cards on minimum payments totaling ~$1200. Food for 4+ baby ~$750 ish.
Dilemma here is that with a few small repairs ($2500 or less) I can sell my house and have $45k-$55k+ in hand to pay off debts and restructure cash flow and live happily ever after (after approx. 90 days). Catch is that I need to save up $ to make repairs and save for move out expenses like deposits, movers and such. 2nd Catch is that the proceeds from selling will take 60-90 days to arrive. 3rd catch is that I really can’t cut food very much without making whiny family whine about rice and PB&amp;J and man is my sanity on thin ice.

Here are my thoughts so far:

Option 1: Quit paying mortgage. Pro: Big boost to cash flow. Would only rack up one late fee per month until closing date. Con: Will have to make some payments to keep it from reporting on credit?  

Option 2: Quit paying credit cards. Pro: Bigger boost to cash flow. Won’t cause any hassle at closing as it’s not related to the house. Con: Late fees. Up to x 7 each month and will have to make some payments before windfall to avoid landing on credit report.

Option 3: Seek out some personal loan or possibly line of credit on the house. At this point, I’m not sure we’d even be approved for more unsecured debt at any price. Pro: No late fees. No dings on credit other than the additional debt. Con: More debt. Transaction costs. Credit union I discussed this with said it could be 60 days til I receive money and might only be able to borrow like under $10k, so I’m paying transaction costs and interest to essentially facilitate moving out. Also stretches out my timeline.

Additional info: I’m not planning any major purchases like a home or vehicle within the next 2 years, so although I’d really like to avoid it, I’m thinking it’s probably not the end of the world if a few things land on the credit report. Maybe it doesn’t matter, but I am under the impression that having a few things hit 30 days overdue isn’t as bad as having things 60 days overdue? 
I’m open to any other suggestions you might have. Thanks, all!

Edit: mess caused by medical bills and stretches of unemployment and a series of calamities, not mismanagement and lavish lifestyle. Looking for advice negotiating next 2-6 months, not reevaluating my whole budget. Selling house will enable me to pay off a few items with large monthly payments, freeing up enough cash flow to actually start paying stuff off. I have a plan. This is one step in the plan. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;d like to keep things focused on the next step, not how I got here. I know exactly how I got here. Unemployment + medical bills will (God willing) not be an issue going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line up front: My cash flow is totally maxed. Trying to decide on a temporary solution. Income is good but I CAN NOT catch a break (car repairs, medical bills, etc).
Non-negotiable expenses (Day care, utilities, car payment, etc): roughly 50% of monthly income.
Possibly (temporarily) Negotiable expenses (Mortgage, Credit card payments, food): Mortgage ~$1100. 7 credit cards on minimum payments totaling ~$1200. Food for 4+ baby ~$750 ish.
Dilemma here is that with a few small repairs ($2500 or less) I can sell my house and have $45k-$55k+ in hand to pay off debts and restructure cash flow and live happily ever after (after approx. 90 days). Catch is that I need to save up $ to make repairs and save for move out expenses like deposits, movers and such. 2nd Catch is that the proceeds from selling will take 60-90 days to arrive. 3rd catch is that I really can’t cut food very much without making whiny family whine about rice and PB&amp;amp;J and man is my sanity on thin ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my thoughts so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1: Quit paying mortgage. Pro: Big boost to cash flow. Would only rack up one late fee per month until closing date. Con: Will have to make some payments to keep it from reporting on credit?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 2: Quit paying credit cards. Pro: Bigger boost to cash flow. Won’t cause any hassle at closing as it’s not related to the house. Con: Late fees. Up to x 7 each month and will have to make some payments before windfall to avoid landing on credit report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 3: Seek out some personal loan or possibly line of credit on the house. At this point, I’m not sure we’d even be approved for more unsecured debt at any price. Pro: No late fees. No dings on credit other than the additional debt. Con: More debt. Transaction costs. Credit union I discussed this with said it could be 60 days til I receive money and might only be able to borrow like under $10k, so I’m paying transaction costs and interest to essentially facilitate moving out. Also stretches out my timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional info: I’m not planning any major purchases like a home or vehicle within the next 2 years, so although I’d really like to avoid it, I’m thinking it’s probably not the end of the world if a few things land on the credit report. Maybe it doesn’t matter, but I am under the impression that having a few things hit 30 days overdue isn’t as bad as having things 60 days overdue? 
I’m open to any other suggestions you might have. Thanks, all!&lt;/p&gt;

Hear me out.

I don't want kids. In fact I could not birth children without dying, so that is extremely unlikely to happen. I am no longer close to any of my few remaining family. I'd like to find a partner someday, but with no kids the odds of us not being fully financially independent from each other is slim.

I also have no desire to live to an age where I need to rely on others fully. I already have a Do Not Resuscitate Order filed. I'd be perfectly happy dropping dead at 60.

I have a personal Roth that I've been contributing to for a few years and I'm vested in a State Retirement Pension from a previous job for a small amount. So I'm not entirely letting things go.

I feel like I stepped into a pile of gold, but I just don't know if I need it. Would it be better for me to just keep my paycheck and enjoy my spoils now while I'm alive?

My wife’s new job will be about a 30% pay raise with a company vehicle provided. They will pay for gas, maintenance and insurance. The only thing we have to pay for is $200 a month for some sort of govt fee. We can also use it as a personal vehicle. 

Her current vehicle she drove a lot for this past job so we are underwater on it, even with this last company paying that car payment. We weren’t smart about it and did a 6 year loan and didn’t put any extra monthly on the payment. So here is are some of the current numbers:

* Her current SUV has 85k miles on it and got the vehicle 2 years ago
* Current SUV payment is $490 monthly 
* the loan is 27k at 3.75% and the vehicle it’s worth about 17k
* the new company vehicle has 40k miles on it and they said she could get a new vehicle(possibly an SUV) with them when it hits 100k, which should be in a couple years. 

The reason she doesn’t want to sell her SUV is because the company vehicle they are giving her is a van. We are both in our early 30s with no kids and she does not want to drive a van on weekends and after work. I told her we can share my paid off vehicle but she doesn’t want to do that as she doesn’t like my vehicle.

Some concerns that I have with keeping her SUV is having a 27k loan with a $490 car payment for a car she barely drives sounds insane to me. Not to mention insurance, maintenance(full warranty until 100k). We could also use that extra money monthly towards other things, like extra on the mortgage (we want to get our dream house in 3 years) our retirement( I have about 65k, but she has currently zero because her last job didn’t provide anything. She is going to go hard on retirement starting now) or just to build a vacation fund or anything we may want.   

I’m sure I’m missing a few things but this has caused a big issue between us. She said she is putting her foot down on this and I’m kind of saying the same thing. I will say that I’m a very frugal person and she isn’t. 

To give you more of an idea of our financial situation this new job will give us about another $1500 a month. If we kept her currently vehicle it would leave us $1000 an extra buy then after retirement we may be looking at maybe only  $500 extra. Right now by no means are we poor but we are definitely not rich either. I will also mention this new job will make her income about 30k more than mine. 

My ideal solution would be to sell her suv, share my vehicle and pay the monthly payment until we get the car paid( probably could pay extra and get it paid off in 8 months). I thought maybe sell my car and get like a 15k car we both like. My car is worth about 6k with 100k miles but the engine and transmission only has 50k miles. 


I really would like a second opinion on this. Your thoughts on what I proposed or what a compromise might be?

Sorry this was so long. 


TLDR- wife got new job that’s $15000 more a month. they provides company vehicle, we pay $200 a month for that but everything  else covered. Current vehicle has a $490 car payment for the  next 4 years and we are underwater on it 10k. Wife doesn’t want to sell it because the new company vehicle is a van and she doesn’t want to drive that after work or on the weekends. I said I can get a new vehicle or new car we can share. She is being stubborn and keeping the SUV seems like a horrible idea. Thoughts? Opinions? A suggestive compromise ?

My healthy, 80 year-old grandma needs to figure out what to do with her money to ***maximize a safe and passive income that she can live on for her remaining lifespan. She's healthy, so I think it's prudent to plan for another 10 years -- at the very least.***

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the situation:

She owns two properties, one of which is on the market now for 1 million, though we're not sure if she'll get that.

She lives on the other property, which is valued at a little over a million and has a $300,000 mortgage on it at 3.5% interest -- 30 year loan.

She receives around $1,700/month (or around $20,400/yr) from social security.

If she's able to sell her second house for the asking price, I estimate she'll end up with around $800,000 after taxes and fees. Then she'll immediately pay of her $300,000 mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is: what should she do with the remaining $500,000? She wants to have a safe, reliable, and steady passive-income on top of her $20,000 yearly social security. She currently lives on around $70,000/yr, but she can probably reduce that to $50,000 or less.

&amp;#x200B;

***tl;dr***

***Income: $20,400/yr***

***Expenses: \~$50,000/yr***

***Money from second house sale after taxes: \~$800,000***

***Mortgage on first house to pay: \~$300,000***

***Cash leftover (to invest): $500,000***

&amp;#x200B;

So what would you do with the cash she makes from her sale in order to stretch the money to live on for another 15 to 20 years? How should she invest it?

Edit: She does not want to sell the house she lives in -- she wants to live in it until she dies.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I make about 36k a year. My fiancé makes about 62k a year, but has debt as well. 
We were managing until we traded an older vehicle for a newer one after a miscommunication from his employer about his salary, we ended up about $700 less a month than originally calculated. which is that payment. 
We don’t really own much of value other than the vehicles, furniture, electronics. All of my accounts are current, but they won’t be for much longer if something doesn’t change.

I have a credit card through Wells Fargo that has been open since 2012 which I always paid off in full up until this year, 2018. I stopped spending on the card over a month ago and currently I owe $6,000 on it. My minimum payments are $405.00. I cannot find where my interest is but I believe it is about 12%. 

**Current hardship:**
I don’t think I can afford $405 each month but as of right now I am having problems with my full time job (not scheduling me the past 2 weeks and failing to pay me for a few days worked) and I cannot pay anything more than $50 this month (out of my savings), and possibly nothing else for the upcoming month. I am seeking other job sites under the same employer and also applying to new jobs. 

**Income and spending:**
Typically, I make about $333.00 a week from employment. And my son receives SSI benefits for $691.00 a month. I also have 2 other credit cards that have higher interest (20+%) and their minimum payments are $27.00. My other bills, including rent, gas, daycare, etc., come out to about $1000-$1200. 

My credit score went from 700something to 555. I cannot be approved for personal loans or balance transfer cards. I even asked a credit union for help and they told me not to bother or it will pull hard on my score.

I started budgeting with the mint app and this has helped me get rid of terrible spending habits. I spent about $1000 less than June the past two months. I don’t go out, party/drink, I don’t buy random things, if my children need clothes I go to thrift stores, etc. We eat on a budget and have WIC. I only pay for essentials. I am still working on improving my spending habits though, such as driving less or getting coupons. 

**My two options:**

A) Hang tight, wait for better employment, and take a $37 late fee. Maybe take another $37 late fee the next month. Pay back everything in 2 months time. Make staggered payments so that I can reach the $405 monthly minimum payment. 

B) Apply for a repayment plan with Wells Fargo. This will close out the card account and it cannot be reopened (they could not answer me on whether or not this would negatively impact my credit score). Applying will close out the card, even if they decline me for the plan. The plan will create a lower fixed monthly minimum payment and lower the interest, however they could not give me any specifics until I apply. 

So what do you think I should do and do you have any other advice for me? Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and in advance, for helping me out. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the credit card:&lt;/strong&gt;

The plan will create a lower fixed monthly minimum payment and lower the interest, however they could not give me any specifics until I apply. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm 19 years old and just started my junior year of university. I'm about 25k in student debt.

For the most part, I really don't have too many assets. I make very little money off of music, but not enough to make it a full time thing. I normally work every summer, but that money usually goes to school or helping my parent for rent and other expenses.

If y'all could either drop some links to good sites or just give me a blueprint as to what I should be doing to better myself financially, it would be much appreciated whether it be the simple stuff such as saving and what not.

Originally, my Cigna insurance was supposed to cover most of it, and I'd only pay a 20% copay. Unfortunately, somewhere between the insurance company and the hospital, something fell through and it's not looking like I'll get that coverage any time in the near or even distant future.

So I was wondering if it would be financial suicide to take out a loan for this procedure, or if there's a way I can do it that would make it work. Similar to a car payment or something.

Basically, when I terminated my Centurylink service in September of 2017, I payed off everything, packed up the modem and sent it back. I moved to a different state, forwarded my mail to my new address, and lived happily for 10 months.  We started looking at houses and I applied to get pre approved through a mortgage loan company.  When they ran my credit they said my current credit was about 100 points lower than I expected and what I see when I use Mint. They said Centurylink had sent a balance to collections that I knew nothing about. I called Centurylink and they said I never returned the modem. I know for a fact I returned the modem because I remember packing it up and thinking how well it fit in the box. They asked for me to provide the tracking number from almost a year ago which I did not keep track of. I called UPS and they said because Centurylink uses their preprinted labels, the tracking number is in their account and cannot be accessed. Centurylink says they do not keep track of the tracking number as they ONLY mail out a preprinted label when service is terminated. A practice which is now changed, as you can get an electronic version now. I've spoke with 30+ people in Centurylink trying to convince them that I know I sent the modem back and it simply wasn't scanned in when they received it. Which I 100% know I sent it back. One nice lady agreed that was a possibility and it was ridiculous to hurt my credit that much over such a small thing and attempted to credit my account. They said it takes a few days to process and when I called back a few days later, the credit was apparently rejected by the crediting department citing the reason for rejection as ""how did she know I returned the equipment.""

I really don't know what to do. I never received a notification whether it be email/letter/phone call prior to this going to collections and it's really not about the $105 they're asking for the modem.

It's about that now it's gone to collections and hurt my credit score, that even a 0.25% increase in interest rate on a $200k loan is $13,000 over 30 years. It's coming down to the fact that this simple tracking number is worth thousands of dollars it seems. 

The mortgage loan advisor said to get a letter that said the balance was reported in error to the credit companies since I actually sent it back. But at this point it seems impossible to do that. Do I simply pay it off and ask for a zero balance letter? Is that equal or different to a letter saying they reported it in error? Am I overreacting and it won't hurt my credit as bad as I think?

I work 2 PT jobs. 7 Days a week. Up to 60 hours per week. Each job gives me 2 days off but they never line up.

Job #1: Best Buy

Title: Asset Protection

Schedule: 9:45 - ~4:00pm; 2 random days off during the week.

Working hours: 22 - 32 hrs/week

Pay: $12.50/hour


Job #2: UPS

Title: Loader

Schedule: 5 - 10pm; weekends off.

Working hours: 25 - 28 hrs/week

Pay: $10.35/hour; OT $15.50 after 5 hours during any shift. (Union contract being negotiated to base pay $13/hour but still needs to be ratified)

I'm currently trying to bring my family to the US via immigration process so I need the money. One job is not enough, and two is ""too much"". And I say that in quotes because it still seems that I'm not making good money, despite my efforts.

I knew that down the line I would have to pick one or other, but I feel that it's getting closer by the day, as I grow exhausted. But I have no idea which one would be better in the long run.

With that being said:

I really enjoy Best Buy. I'm a nerd, so I like tech and games and all that. Management showed great appreciation for my work and offered me a full-time position recently. I declined only because I wasn't sure about them as a long-term career. Plus, their family health plan costs $200 per month.

UPS on the other hand... is a miserable, soul-sucking job. But... are in need of drivers. Which start at $31.50/hr... but also have terrible hours (even for people who have been there for over 20 years). Also, the health plan costs $0 for you and your dependents. However, since they are union, I'm currently on a bidding list to become a driver, with absolutely no idea if I'm even going to get called at all.

I fear that if I leave Best Buy then I'll miss out on working with what I enjoy + learning valuable skills. And that I'll be stuck working in a warehouse — a place which I loath going to work everyday — in case I don't get the driver position.

Simultaneously, I fear that if I leave UPS, then I'll miss out on potentially becoming a driver with satisfactory pay to support my family, and great health plan. I also fear being stuck at that $12.50/hr with the slow and disproportionate annual raises.

I honestly have **NO** idea what to do.

&lt;p&gt;I work 2 PT jobs. 7 Days a week. Up to 60 hours per week. Each job gives me 2 days off but they never line up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job #1: Best Buy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title: Asset Protection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schedule: 9:45 - ~4:00pm; 2 random days off during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working hours: 22 - 32 hrs/week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay: $12.50/hour&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job #2: UPS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title: Loader&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schedule: 5 - 10pm; weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working hours: 25 - 28 hrs/week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay: $10.35/hour; OT $15.50 after 5 hours during any shift. (Union contract being negotiated to base pay $13/hour but still needs to be ratified)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently trying to bring my family to the US via immigration process so I need the money. One job is not enough, and two is &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot;. And I say that in quotes because it still seems that I&amp;#39;m not making good money, despite my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that down the line I would have to pick one or other, but I feel that it&amp;#39;s getting closer by the day, as I grow exhausted. But I have no idea which one would be better in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy Best Buy. I&amp;#39;m a nerd, so I like tech and games and all that. Management showed great appreciation for my work and offered me a full-time position recently. I declined only because I wasn&amp;#39;t sure about them as a long-term career. Plus, their family health plan costs $200 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPS on the other hand... is a miserable, soul-sucking job. But... are in need of drivers. Which start at $31.50/hr... but also have terrible hours (even for people who have been there for over 20 years). Also, the health plan costs $0 for you and your dependents. However, since they are union, I&amp;#39;m currently on a bidding list to become a driver, with absolutely no idea if I&amp;#39;m even going to get called at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that if I leave Best Buy then I&amp;#39;ll miss out on working with what I enjoy + learning valuable skills. And that I&amp;#39;ll be stuck working in a warehouse — a place which I loath going to work everyday — in case I don&amp;#39;t get the driver position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, I fear that if I leave UPS, then I&amp;#39;ll miss out on potentially becoming a driver with satisfactory pay to support my family, and great health plan. I also fear being stuck at that $12.50/hr with the slow and disproportionate annual raises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly have &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt; idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, in a paper notification only that I mistakenly ignored because I had signed up for online billing, 1st Financial Bank decided to start charging an annual fee. This is something they never did before. I never use this card anymore because I have other cards that give me cash back or points. Should I cancel my 1st Financial Bank credit card so that I don't have to pay this annual fee? The fee is $55 and I already asked to see if there was a change of product to a different card without a fee and this is the only card they offer. It is my first and thus longest line of credit history that I have and I am worried that it will hurt my credit score by closing it. But how badly will it hurt my score? Will it lower it below 750, if so then maybe is it worth keeping it open and paying the annual fee? If it wont hurt my score that much then maybe I should cancel it so I don't have to pay this annual fee for a card I never use and that has no rewards or perks.

I'm completely new to this subreddit, I'll try to keep this question/description fairly short.  


I'm basically wondering if there's some sort of private financial advisor or expert I can use as a personal resource for investigating tax questions, maybe even doing my taxes for me wherever I am without it costing me a fortune. In the last five years, I've lived in Australia (2 years), in Canada and now I've recently moved to Spain. Next year I might move to France, but hoping to settle down there.  


Backstory:

I'm originally from Norway, and I find that it's so easy to get overwhelmed or not give a shit about doing things right in terms of taxes and my pension, because finding information online or even if you call the tax agency in Norway I feel it's hard to get short and sweet answers on how to handle living like I have been for the last few years. I still have to go back and correct my taxes for when I lived in Australia, because I didn't realize that when I paid taxes down there I would get most of it back. And I didn't put two and two together, so I spent the money on travelling when I got it back. In hindsight I feel stupid for not considering all this back then, but I was honestly too busy living life to the fullest. The worst thing is I could have paid it all back in full back then, I had savings to spare. When I found out, I hadn't been working for a while and couldn't really afford to deal with it.  


Any tips are welcome from people with experience from similar situations, or if someone has a good idea of what I should do in terms of having someone assist me directly. I don't know, maybe an auditor or someone with a lot of experience can give some insight. This post is sorta neither here nor there and I don't know if it makes sense, but I know I should at least try to get some assistance with all this.

I think the biggest thing concerning me is my student loan debt. I currently am not required to make any payment on it, so I haven't, but I just recently learned how interest and capitalization accrues and that's what scares me. No one really teaches you how student loans work when you take them out so that's why I've been completely clueless to how they work and why I've put them off. I recently started using YNAB thanks to some advice I've seen given, so that way I can hold myself accountable on what I'm really spending and to get it under control. 

When I write this all out, it seems pretty daunting, so I'd really appreciate any feedback on how I should go about managing my finances better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I&amp;#39;m new to the reddit world, but I&amp;#39;ve been following this subreddit for a little and I&amp;#39;ve really learned a lot and it&amp;#39;s made me reevaluate some financial decisions I need to make in my life.

5 years ago I lost my job and found out my wife was pregnant on the same day.

A few months later my wife was laid off as well. Long story short, I was unemployed almost the entire pregnancy, didn't find a job in time for new health insurance to kick in, we blew through everything we had in savings, etc, just to stay afloat. We ended up being forced to put essential things on credit cards and eventually had no choice but to file bankruptcy.

Now we are both working again and trying to save. We rent an apartment but really want a house for our daughter, with a yard, and a decent school system, etc. Housing is expensive here, and we are slowly saving but still have a long ways to go. We are in our mid 30s and running out of time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an old 401k from a previous job that has around 20k in it. My current job has a retirement/pension plan that I am forced to pay 7% of my pay into, and won't be able to touch until retirement.

I'd like to pull out of my 401k to use as much as I can for a down payment on a home. I know everyone is against this idea, but I am reasonably confident that my pension will be enough for me when I am older, and right now what is important to me is getting a home for my family.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best way to withdraw this 401k with the least amount of penalties?

I've heard I can put it into an IRA first, penalty-free, and then withdraw and only pay taxes?

Otherwise I could just withdraw outright, and pay the 10% penalty plus the taxes (24%?)

Apparently you can also withdraw from a 401k specifically FOR a home down payment, but limited to certain amounts.

Are there any other options or suggestions? Again, I know this isn't always advised, but I'd rather not have all this money locked up in 2 retirement funds, when I could be using it to provide a better life for my daughter.

Thanks for any input.

So I’m a graduate student in Boston. As we all know rent prices in Boston are a little bit wild. I’m currently paying roughly 1900/Month for an apartment for my roommate and I. When my lease is over though, I’m considering a different option.

At the term of my lease I’ll still have minimum 4-5 years left in Boston. I’m considering buying a small house in a suburb of Boston. I’ve personally seen and toured some decent examples in okay areas that would cost about 150,000 or apparently an estimated all in monthly cost of 900/mo (that my roommate and I would split.) I would be the one buying the house and my roommate would rent from me.

What’s the catch here? Would I really be saving money short term and building equity long term or am I missing something here?

Also, I can afford the down payment as I worked in industry for a few years prior to grad school so I have some nice cushy savings.

I was looking at a used crv at 9k locally. Capital one rate is over 10%, should I take the capital one offer to my credit union. I have no idea what I'm doing so any help is useful. Credit score 658 with bad cc utilization. 

UPDATE:
So I very much appreciate all of the responses! 

the original 900 I spent was not just on brakes, also exhaust manifold. I should have clarified earlier. 
Mechanic just got back to me and said that the alternator will be a little over 400 total. 
I want to shop around for car loan rates as I think getting something with a low payment for now will at least help to offset the outrageous amount of money I put weekly into gassing up the Mercury (gets like 15mpg, with the tranny issue more like 8mpg). Also I feel like a crv will just straight up last longer than this thing to help me get caught up with debts. Even with the 10% rate from cap one the car payment would be 185 after my trade in and down payment. 
I need to get at least a crv size compact SUV as I have two small children and two car seats lol.

So the question now is how do I avoid too many hard inquires on my report. I have the pre-approval offer from cap one, should I just take that to the credit union? If I go to a dealership I feel like I'm gonna get three hard inquiries.

Can someone here help me navigate the differences and pros-cons of accepting the offer for NSO instead? What are the tax implications in the short and long term?


I have the option to keep the ISOs if I want.
I'm currently in the 28% tax bracket if it helps...

I'm sure this question or some variant of it has been asked a million times, but I'm looking for some personalized guidance on this.

Switching jobs and the new job has a one year waiting period before being eligible for their 401k. I have just over $4,000 in my current 401k (and I believe all of it is vested). From the research I've done, it looks like if you have under $5,000, the employer you're leaving can force you out of the 401k, but that hasn't been discussed. From the talks I've had here, my current 401k will sit there untouched until I'm eligible for the new 401k at the new job and roll it all over.

Am I correct in saying that there's no way to manually contribute to a 401k? If I can't deposit anything into it myself, and I have to wait a year from starting my new job to roll it over into the new 401k, what do I do in the meantime?

Some websites suggest opening up an IRA, but I don't see the point in doing that just for one year, because my understanding is that a Roth IRA cannot be rolled over into a 401k. So even after a year, yes I'll have some money saved in the IRA, but now I have both an IRA and 401k that I'm splitting money between. Wouldn't it make more sense for me to put as much as I could into one? I won't be maxing out contributions or anything like that.

I also have a WiseBanyan investment account, kind of just for fun, there's only a few hundred dollars in there now, but considering it's already up and running and I can deposit money into it at anytime, should I just contribute more to that during the next year? 

I definitely want to keep the habit of saving and setting money aside, but I'm just worried about my retirement savings taking a  hit and being a year behind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all.

Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but it does have to do with my finances, so I figured I'd give it a shot. 

So on my most recent pay stub, I noticed that I'm making an extra $2/hr. I was pretty happy, cause yay money. 

But it feels off. Now, I get raises fairly frequently at my job, but usually they're in $1/hr increments. I've gotten 2, $2/hr raises in the the 5 years I've been there, but that was only when I negotiated it. My random ""youre doing a good job"" raises are $1/hr. 

We did have a meeting between all the licensed personel and upper management, where they basically went around the circle and asked ""how can we make you guyd happy?"" (Moral has been low because of how insanely busy it's been, but I'm sure that means business is good.) My answer was ""I like money.""

So the raise makes sense. But to boost moral, wouldn't they tell me about it, as opposed to hoping I'd notice it on the pay stub? 

My worry is, if I say something, they may dock my next check if it was an error. A few months ago, they realized they weren't actually charging our dental insurance, so they just back charged us like 6 months worth on one check, without warning. It was only like $100 extra before taxes, but still really annoying when I wasn't planning for it. 

Frankly, even if it is an error, I'm hoping they just don't notice (they're awful at bookkeeping) but the longer i wait to ""thank them for the raise"" the more they could potentially dock.

I'm still relatively early in my career; I expect within the next couple of years I'll change employers and aim to be earning around $75k-$80k (not unreasonable; I like my current employer a lot but they pay quite a bit under the average for our area).

I want to close the old account (because the individual who accessed my account surely took down my acct/routing numbers) but I can't because their money is still sitting there...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I move the money over to my new checking and just pay them when they inevitably ask for it? Would that look shady? What if months go by and they haven't taken it back?

Background was for context re: the circumstances in which I opened the account.

Background:  My parents are financially volatile but also extremely controlling.  I have been financially independent for a large portion of my life to their ire as they use money as a control tactic (eg. my mom will offer to help pay car insurance, then my step dad will use it as leverage to threaten to cut me off unless I do what they want).  I am a 24 years old engineering student, have two jobs that equal about 35 hours a week at $13/hr and $15/hr respectively, and pay my own tuition/rent/bills out of pocket (I do not currently have student loans, except one I took out at 18 for $10,000 for a different program).  I have around $3000 in my savings and am extremely frugal.  I do not currently pay rent as I live in a van, but am staying at my parents house while I do some work on it.  I do not smoke/drink/do drugs.

Current dilemma:  My financial situation has been quite stagnant the past few years and I feel like saving is two steps forward, three steps back.  Despite having relatively low expenses, and dumping most of my paycheck into my savings account, it seems to go up incredibly slow.  Somehow on a recent outing with my mom she convinced me to open a stock account as a good way to capitalize on my savings and maybe make some money toward school.  Again, I know they are terrible with money, but somehow my brain decided this was a reasonable idea.  I opened an account with BMO and transferred over $500.  Now I am freaking out because a.  After some research I realize my parents are purchasing penny stocks and b. I literally know nothing about trading.  Zilch.  Zero.

Is there any way I can make this work, or should I close the account and put my hard saved cash back in my safe savings account?  I can't really afford a loss right now as I have a few major expenses coming up (car repair, tuition/books, YMCA membership).  I am already having anxiety and I haven't even placed an order yet.

TL;DR Let my Beverly Hillbilly debt-ridden parents convince me, an idiot, to become a daytrader with no financial knowledge whatsoever.

I am a 22 year old, fresh out of College graduate; ready to take on the world. Currently, I am working as a server at Not Your Average Joe's and make fairly decent money, in cash every week. I just bought a new car secondhand and I am trying to save up and hopefully move out with my friends at the beginning of next summer.

Now, I have about 1,000 currently to pay on my credit card which I am trying to pay off very quickly. I also have about 55k in student loans, where I don'y have to start paying on until March of 2020. I know I have some work to do in regards to reconsolidating my loans and getting one fixed rate, and we are planning on doing that soon. I also have to worry about the interest I have had building up as well.

I need to know what the best way to go about saving my money working as a server. Every day, I put between 10-15% of what I made in my savings and so far for this month alone I'm almost at $300! Last month, I did this strategy and I was able to save about $900, in which I used it all towards my credit card.

My question is should I do this again and take the money from my savings and use that to pay off my card, or just throw whatever I have left  in my checking at the end of the month after my big expenses (car insurance, car payment -  $300)

on the card and keep letting my savings account stack up?

I need to start putting something towards my loans now, as I have a year and a half to start taking care of that before I have to pay them, but also with interest each month, I am aware it wouldn't hurt to start putting something on them now.  I also would like to start saving for when I want to move out with my friends and at the same time I am trying my hardest to pay off my credit cards as fast as I can now.

I am also considering opening up a separate savings account with a good interest rate to maximize my savings/ put it into my Robinhood investing app. 

I look forward to hearing your responses and appreciate any help!

Thank you

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have about 1,000 currently to pay on my credit card which I am trying to pay off very quickly. I also have about 55k in student loans, where I don&amp;#39;y have to start paying on until March of 2020. I know I have some work to do in regards to reconsolidating my loans and getting one fixed rate, and we are planning on doing that soon. I also have to worry about the interest I have had building up as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to know what the best way to go about saving my money working as a server. Every day, I put between 10-15% of what I made in my savings and so far for this month alone I&amp;#39;m almost at $300! Last month, I did this strategy and I was able to save about $900, in which I used it all towards my credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is should I do this again and take the money from my savings and use that to pay off my card, or just throw whatever I have left  in my checking at the end of the month after my big expenses (car insurance, car payment -  $300)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the card and keep letting my savings account stack up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to start putting something towards my loans now, as I have a year and a half to start taking care of that before I have to pay them, but also with interest each month, I am aware it wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt to start putting something on them now.  I also would like to start saving for when I want to move out with my friends and at the same time I am trying my hardest to pay off my credit cards as fast as I can now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also considering opening up a separate savings account with a good interest rate to maximize my savings/ put it into my Robinhood investing app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing your responses and appreciate any help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

I want to be able to pay both. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I live with my parents. I'm making anywhere between $1.6K - 3K a month, but that's through an internship where I have to pay taxes in the form of a 1099. There is currently no interest on the student loan, but my grace period will end by January and from there, I'll have to add interest on top of it. I do not want to pay the interest, and would rather pay it off entirely now. I make closer to $2K-3K right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was to work as many hours as I could to pay off my student loan within the next two months, but I don't think that's feasible. Since I got the loan from my University, I cannot get my transcript or diploma until I pay off the entire amount. I really need the transcript to apply to a Master's Program, but they will not let me. I also can't refinance it through the Federal government, nor can I get a private loan to cover it due to being late to build up credit. The issue is that I need my transcript for employers. I can't verify my GPA, because the University will not let ANYONE see this data until I pay the amount off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't know what spending all of my money on that loan would look to the IRS, either. I don't know how long the internship will last for, so I'm reticent on spending all of my income on that and have nothing left over for taxes. I would have to pay that by January 15th. A friend of mine has offered to pay for half of my student loan debt, but I'm unsure on what a payment schedule would look like, mostly because I'd still have to factor in paying for the other half of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would be a good payment schedule to pay off my debt? The internship I'm doing is not even in the field I want to get into, but it's the highest paying job I can get right now. I've put off applying to my actual field by a year for this, because there's NO way I can apply to any University without even an unofficial transcript. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have 5.5K in Student Loans left and another 1.5K left over in the form of a personal loan. I want to be able to pay both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I live with my parents. I&amp;#39;m making anywhere between $1.6K - 3K a month, but that&amp;#39;s through an internship where I have to pay taxes in the form of a 1099. There is currently no interest on the student loan, but my grace period will end by January and from there, I&amp;#39;ll have to add interest on top of it. I do not want to pay the interest, and would rather pay it off entirely now. I make closer to $2K-3K right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to work as many hours as I could to pay off my student loan within the next two months, but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s feasible. Since I got the loan from my University, I cannot get my transcript or diploma until I pay off the entire amount. I really need the transcript to apply to a Master&amp;#39;s Program, but they will not let me. I also can&amp;#39;t refinance it through the Federal government, nor can I get a private loan to cover it due to being late to build up credit. The issue is that I need my transcript for employers. I can&amp;#39;t verify my GPA, because the University will not let ANYONE see this data until I pay the amount off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t know what spending all of my money on that loan would look to the IRS, either. I don&amp;#39;t know how long the internship will last for, so I&amp;#39;m reticent on spending all of my income on that and have nothing left over for taxes. I would have to pay that by January 15th. A friend of mine has offered to pay for half of my student loan debt, but I&amp;#39;m unsure on what a payment schedule would look like, mostly because I&amp;#39;d still have to factor in paying for the other half of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

It is coming up to the time where I would like to ask my director for an extension to my contract, I was wondering if I should ask a pay rise with that?

When I was hired I was told my job was essentially data entry for a few months and then see what happens after that.

However during those months 2 substantial things have happened.

1) I graduated university, I did not have a degree when I was employed but now I do. I am currently being paid £4000 a year less than the average annual salary for someone with my degree (aerospace engineering).
2) my manager quit his job, leaving me as the only employee with knowledge of the project and essentially the only person in a position to run it or at least guide it in the right direction for the time being.

Clearly since I was employed my responsibilities have increased massively (from data entry to running a project that has massively increased in scale) and I am now far more qualified than I was at the time.

When negotiating the contract extension, should I also ask for a raise. I was thinking of asking for a 25% raise (from £20000 to £25000). £4000 raise to bring my pay in to line with people of equal qualification and £1000 to compensate for the massive increase in responsibility.

I'm a recent college graduate who very luckily got an ok paying job right after graduation. Salary of 45k. Making around $2,800 monthly w/ taxes deducted, have been religiously saving 2k every month since May. 

I still live at home with the birthgivers, so I am very lucky regarding the rest of my finances. I'm trying to hoard my money for the time being.

My loans are currently around 22k, with $1,300 already accrued. My interest accumulates daily. Interest rate is around 4.5%.

My first loan payment is due this January and the minimum payment for me to pay it off in 10 years is around $260 monthly. This is doable but I do not want to spend the next 10 years paying off my loans.

By December (accounting for Christmas gifts, possible unforeseen car issues, etc), I should have about 14k in my savings.

Should I bite the bullet and put anywhere between 5-7k to my loans *or* up my monthly payment by $350-$450? I'm the first to graduate in my family, and the first to acquire student loans. Neither my family or friends have any experience in what to do...I would really appreciate any kind of advice.

Thank you in advance! So nervous/excited.

&lt;p&gt;Is there any reason this would typically happen? Should I be worried at all? This seems pretty shady and I definitely dont want this to affect my credit score. Any advice is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

28M nurse here on the east coast in a major city. I currently make $88K baseline but pick up overtime opportunities frequently and am expected to make $100-105K this year. I am currently pretty frugal and with extra monthly income, have already been putting 15% of my paycheck towards a Vanguard 403(B) plan (50/50 between VOO and 2055 fund), currently at $34k balance. In addition, I am making monthly contributions towards a Roth IRA with Vanguard as well to max it out by the end of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

For my current student loans, I recently refinanced the loan amount for a five year fixed rate plan at 5% with a fixed payment of $927 through SoFi loans. After speaking to SoFi today and going over the details of my loan agreement, there is no penalty for paying off my loan early, which was a surprise to me. With this new information, I now realize I have the option to pay off my loan early.

&amp;#x200B;

Given this circumstance, what guidance can you give me? I can reduce the contributions towards retirement to help pay the loan off faster, but given the aggressive nature of my portfolio for retirement, my returns have far outperformed my loan rate (avg. 15% for the past two years). I realize 15% is extremely good and not an indicator of the long term market by any means. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Should I keep putting money towards retirement or wipe out my student loans at 5% rate?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings,&lt;/p&gt;

Long time lurker, first time poster here.  I’ve seen some well written and thought out advice on this subreddit over the years and would like your help figuring this out. 

I’m a 33 year old single male.  I have an individual disability insurance policy through Standard Insurance.  It costs me $300 a month.  The benefit is for $4250 a month to age 67.  Being a year round motorcyclist in San Francisco and in a physically arduous career, I like the peace of mind that comes from having such a policy.  However, I'm having a difficult time saving money.  Feels like I've just been treading water for years.

Should I cancel my policy with Standard?  Should I get a cheaper policy (from a different company) instead?  Do I really need disability insurance?  Does it actually function as advertised?

Here's the breakdown on a month:

$1600 rent

$43.95 life insurance

$300 family support

$43 dues

$2 account activity transfers

$297.92 standard insurance

$156.76 motorcycle loan

$50 internet

$121.93 motorcycle insurance

Fixed expenses = $2,615.56

Net Income = $3577.62

Remainder = $962.06

$962 sounds like a lot to my friends out of state, but in the bay area that goes quick.  Food, gas, vehicle repairs, work related clothing and equipment, etc.  Additionally, family stuff keeps popping up.  I just shelled out $4k to go visit family overseas before they die.  Things like that.

There’s no warranty, as we have over 120,000 miles on it. Since we owe $9000 on the car, I don’t know what to do, except trade it in and go upside down into a new loan on something else. We have zero cash to throw at this at all. 

I am really upset because I really don’t see a way out of this. Is trading it in and going upside down the only option for us, or am I missing something obvious?

Would it even be possible to hide that much negative equity and be able to keep our payments at the current level of around $300/month? Credit score is good, but not great. High utilization (credit cards) is deflating things but no other negatives present on the report. 

I don’t want another transmission of this type (I’m kind of over it right now!) but I do want a reliable SUV of about the same size. Will other dealers even look at my current vehicle since it has a blown CVT transmission and let us trade it in for a decent price? Or am I stuck with getting another Nissan?

What kind of trade in value is this even going to have?

I have never had something hit with no warning and I am beyond anxious. I feel like our finances are going to be in long-term ruin. A 6-7 year car loan is the only thing I can see as even an option and my stomach is absolutely sick over it.

I am expecting a job offer from a prior internship that will be to be ~60-70K pre-tax yearly income in a low cost of living area.  I would say that the likelihood of getting the job are practically guaranteed as they loved the work I had done with them in my prior internships and verbally stated they would want to hire me should I want to pursue a career with them.

I currently have no debt, and I hold ~50K in assets:  ~12K in a Roth IRA (income from two years of past internships), ~14K in a non-tax-advantaged mutual fund (intended for personal retirement savings), and 22K in a high-yield savings account (1.85% APY).

I also own a reliable car as means of transportation, a necessity as the location I will likely be moving to is more rural and does not have public transportation.

I have looked at this sub's investment flowchart, and I have tried to follow it as best I can.  The 22K in savings can act as my emergency fund (roughly 3-4 months of my gross expected income after graduation) as well as to cover whatever costs I have as I settle into the area where this job will be.  I've had put as much of my income into a Roth IRA as I could, since the internships didn't offer any chance at investing in a 401k or other tax-advantaged account, and put a decent amount into a standard internationally diversified mutual fund (60-40 split between US stocks/bonds and foreign stocks/bonds, with a 90-to-10 ratio of stocks to bonds).

I've already made a basic budget to estimate future expenses based on my past expenses.  This was a little hard to do as some of the expenses (namely rent and utilities) are ones I've never had to allocate any money towards before, as I had lived with my family or on-campus prior to this.

However, concerning the future:

* My hopefully soon-to-be-employer offers a 100% match into a 401K up to 4% of my salary that I'm planning on taking full advantage of.
* I'm planning on renting short-term (which is about ~$450-600 per month where I will be moving to, depending on size and location) and looking into home ownership should I decide to stay with the company long-term (more than 1-2 years)
* I'm planning on living as reasonably as possible (staying within/below my means), and I anticipate that I can comfortably save at least 20-25% of my gross income between the Roth IRA, 401K matching, my personal retirement account, and expanding my emergency fund and short-term savings.  This is mostly due to the relatively low cost of living area I'd be moving to in the event that I was hired on full time after graduation.  This should allow me to properly save for future short-term expenses (replacing my car when it becomes cost-inefficient to maintain, putting a down payment on a house, etc.) as well as retirement.

The one thing that is bugging me is how little, relatively speaking, of my current assets I have invested.  I know that everyone says that time in the market is the most influential factor in determining future growth in the stock market, so my gut is telling me that I should divert more of my money that is currently just sitting around in a savings account into a diversified mutual fund.  I currently have no immediate need for the 22K (other than acting as a safety net).

Would it be wise, given my general circumstances, to reduce the size of my emergency fund to invest more heavily in a mutual fund, or am I getting too far ahead of myself?  I recognize the importance of having some money set aside, it just seems like a waste to have so much (~45%) of my current total assets tied to my emergency fund.

In addition, are there any other opportunities or risks/dangers that I haven't yet utilized or considered that could be available to me?  I'm pretty inexperienced with all this, and would love some other pairs of eyes looking at my general plan.

I apologize for the wall of text you're about to encounter but for those who are willing to read it and provide any advice, I thank you.

I am currently 23 years old and have always been pretty good with my finances, but need to make sure I'm on the right track as far as savings/investing goes.

As of currently I have three credit cards with no debt on any, besides this month's payments. In total I have about $1,300 in traditional checking and savings accounts.

Aside from that I have also been using Acorns to invest the equivalent of 5 dollars a day, so around $150 each month, on top of using their round up feature to kind of stash some money there. I know most users here aren't fans of them because of fees, but I am a college student, so no fees at all, but I am open to doing something else with that account, as it was really just set up as a way to get more money out of my normal spending accounts. Total in Acorns I have about $1,700.

I also knew I needed to start taking my retirement stuff into account, so at the second quarter of the year I started taking $100 from each bi-weekly paycheck and putting it into a Betterment Roth IRA, and so far have about $1,400 in there. This was one of the things I notice, is that the recommendation from a lot of people here for people my age was to try putting maybe 25-50 a month in there, and I feel I may be ""overspending"" in a sense for my age.

I also work for a certain trillion dollar company and have been putting a full 6% from my paycheck into a 401k, of which I am getting 75% match for how long I have been here, which I now have almost $10,000 in after four years. I have also been putting 10% of my paycheck into the ESPP and have a bit over $21,000 of sellable stock. These are the only stocks I own and I have not sold any shares. 

Other than that, for ""investing"", I have a bit (&lt;$2000) in crypto currency I bought late last year which I'm down on, but that money is already gone in my mind and I'm okay with just letting it sit and seeing if it does something in the next few years.

I also have $435 in dividends that I foolishly have done nothing with and don't know what best to do with it, but at most I will move that into my savings account.

So running total here is:

$1,300 Cash
$1,700 Acorns (I consider this basically like another savings account at this point)
$1,400 Roth IRA
$10,000 401k
$21,000 stock in one single company (what a risky idiot?)

I have recently opened an American Express savings account with 1.8% interest and am starting to move my savings into that, since the savings account I had all my life up until this point gave me diddly squat. I'd like to put away around $125 a check into this account.

I did buy a car in January and put about $7,000 down on it, and only had to finance around $4,200, and with interest I'll end up paying about $5,000 over the next 5 1/2 years. My monthly payment is $72 so not bad. My car insurance is around $170, I live at home and pay my mom $270 for rent every month and my phone bill is also $72. On top of a few luxuries (video and streaming services and the like) which are only around $50 a month total, I end up having $650 a month worth of payments for things. And mentally I add the $200 for Roth IRA and $150-170ish for the Acorns deductions, putting me around $1,000 every month.

I make around $1,200 a month or so and the rest of my money usually goes to food (which I need to start spending less on, because I overspend on food a lot.)

The real issue is that I am going to be taking on more debt, but in the form of student debt mostly.

As of now the only debt I have is my car, which is manageable. I have been able to pay my way through community college with the help of my company, and I get up to $5,250 per calendar year for reimbursement for school.

I am going into my junior year at a university and am getting the max of $12,500 for federal student loans and am taking out $8,000 in private loans from Discover. I chose to make payments while in school this semester as the amount was about $60 a month which I think is reasonable, and I plan on getting the $5,250 reimbursed in January for which I will immediately pay back onto the Discover loan. I plan on doing this same thing for the following senior year at all the same amounts.

Leaving school I am probably looking about around $30,000 of school loans plus interest, but I am going to school for electrical engineering, so hope to have a good paying job by the time I get out of school.

I pray that these will be really the only loans I have to deal with in the next few years, barring any unexpected situations.

I would ideally like to live in Silicon Valley after graduating, as I live in New England and many of the jobs I want are either there or in Texas, and I don't wish to live in Texas. I realize the Bay Area is expensive, but hey, hopefully that's what the degree is for. However I realize some expectations may have to be reset based on situations.

So that's the whole story. The main thing is I feel like I haven't been increasing my savings outside of what's being deducted from my paycheck into investing accounts really, and am just wondering if there's anything I'm missing or could be doing better with my money that I'm not already doing, or if I'm worrying too much about a Roth IRA amounts and such. Any and all advice is welcome.

My monthly payment is $72 so not bad. My car insurance is around $170, I live at home and pay my mom $270 for rent every month and my phone bill is also $72. On top of a few luxuries (video and streaming services and the like) which are only around $50 a month total, I end up having $650 a month worth of payments for things. And mentally I add the $200 for Roth IRA and $150-170ish for the Acorns deductions, putting me around $1,000 every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make around $1,200 a month or so and the rest of my money usually goes to food (which I need to start spending less on, because I overspend on food a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real issue is that I am going to be taking on more debt, but in the form of student debt mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now the only debt I have is my car, which is manageable. I have been able to pay my way through community college with the help of my company, and I get up to $5,250 per calendar year for reimbursement for school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going into my junior year at a university and am getting the max of $12,500 for federal student loans and am taking out $8,000 in private loans from Discover. I chose to make payments while in school this semester as the amount was about $60 a month which I think is reasonable, and I plan on getting the $5,250 reimbursed in January for which I will immediately pay back onto the Discover loan. I plan on doing this same thing for the following senior year at all the same amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving school I am probably looking about around $30,000 of school loans plus interest, but I am going to school for electrical engineering, so hope to have a good paying job by the time I get out of school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pray that these will be really the only loans I have to deal with in the next few years, barring any unexpected situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would ideally like to live in Silicon Valley after graduating, as I live in New England and many of the jobs I want are either there or in Texas, and I don&amp;#39;t wish to live in Texas. I realize the Bay Area is expensive, but hey, hopefully that&amp;#39;s what the degree is for. However I realize some expectations may have to be reset based on situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s the whole story. The main thing is I feel like I haven&amp;#39;t been increasing my savings outside of what&amp;#39;s being deducted from my paycheck into investing accounts really, and am just wondering if there&amp;#39;s anything I&amp;#39;m missing or could be doing better with my money that I&amp;#39;m not already doing, or if I&amp;#39;m worrying too much about a Roth IRA amounts and such. Any and all advice is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I was taught to treat my credit card essentially as a debit card. So I don't personally know a lot of information on credit card minimums, if they go higher will they ever decrease if you pay it off, what happens when collections agencies call you, etc. My friend does not have this knowledge either. I'm basically making this post for my friend because her situation gives me a lot of anxiety, and she also gave me permission because she doesn't reddit and wants me to do it for her. Which brings us to..  


**The Situation:**  My coworker is in credit card debt. I'm not sure how much exactly (neither is she I don't think.. she said she stopped looking at it because she just doesn't want to deal with it). Her credit card minimum is $1k, so my other friend (who has been in credit card debt before) said that probably means she's in around $10k of total debt? She says she does not have the money to pay the debt off, nor the minimum off. She constantly ignores calls from collections agencies because she's scared (I would be too) and also wants to be in denial and pretend the problem isn't there.  


**Solutions:**  
\- Be more frugal. Don't eat out as much, don't spend as much money going out, etc. She has free lunch at work but she eats out a lot because she doesn't like it. She could possibly save up to $75+/wk. *Her response*: Too hard. We joke about it, and she already knows she should do this, but she says she just can't.  
\- Get a second job. *Her response:* This was also kind of her idea. She was thinking about ubering (but I doubt that'll work with her lifestyle and she already has a full-time job). Maybe dog walking on the side but I heard that makes very little money. Maybe stripping. :insert laughing outside but dying inside emoji:  
\- Other coworker said she's heard of people taking out a certain type of loan to help pay off their credit card debt. *Her response:* Don't know anything about this and the thought of taking a loan to pay another loan is scary. I don't have knowledge here either. Also seems scary. Does anyone here know anything about this?  
\- Ask parents for help. *Her response:* This was an idea a bunch of us threw around. She says her mom can't help and her dad will probably tell her to fix it herself. Both will be very angry. Obviously.  
\- Ask boyfriend/friends for help (mostly just boyfriend). *Her response:* She has (if I remember correctly), and he won't.  
\- Stripping. Again.  


**Questions:**  
\- How does all this work?  
\- Can you pay off the minimum partially or do you have to pay the minimum in full?  
\- If you pay off the minimum partially, will it go down for the next statement? Same question for if you pay the minimum in full  
\- does anyone know anything about a certain type of loan she could take out to pay it off so she pays less interest maybe?  
\- How does the minimum go down?? HOW WILL SHE IMPROVE HER CREDIT SCORE?!?!  
\- Yes, a couple of us have told her she needs to stop ignoring the problem and start answering the phone and looking at her card statement and actually save some money to start.

She was thinking about ubering (but I doubt that&amp;#39;ll work with her lifestyle and she already has a full-time job). Maybe dog walking on the side but I heard that makes very little money. Maybe stripping. :insert laughing outside but dying inside emoji:&lt;br/&gt;
- Other coworker said she&amp;#39;s heard of people taking out a certain type of loan to help pay off their credit card debt. &lt;em&gt;Her response:&lt;/em&gt; Don&amp;#39;t know anything about this and the thought of taking a loan to pay another loan is scary. I don&amp;#39;t have knowledge here either. Also seems scary. Does anyone here know anything about this?&lt;br/&gt;
- Ask parents for help. &lt;em&gt;Her response:&lt;/em&gt; This was an idea a bunch of us threw around. She says her mom can&amp;#39;t help and her dad will probably tell her to fix it herself. Both will be very angry. Obviously.&lt;br/&gt;
- Ask boyfriend/friends for help (mostly just boyfriend). &lt;em&gt;Her response:&lt;/em&gt; She has (if I remember correctly), and he won&amp;#39;t.&lt;br/&gt;
- Stripping. Again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- How does all this work?&lt;br/&gt;
- Can you pay off the minimum partially or do you have to pay the minimum in full?&lt;br/&gt;
- If you pay off the minimum partially, will it go down for the next statement? Same question for if you pay the minimum in full&lt;br/&gt;
- does anyone know anything about a certain type of loan she could take out to pay it off so she pays less interest maybe?&lt;br/&gt;
- How does the minimum go down?? HOW WILL SHE IMPROVE HER CREDIT SCORE?!?!&lt;br/&gt;
- Yes, a couple of us have told her she needs to stop ignoring the problem and start answering the phone and looking at her card statement and actually save some money to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay that&amp;#39;s it I have a lot more anxiety about this than she does and I want to figure out out how to fix it just for personal knowledge but also for her. THANKS!&lt;/p&gt;

Money coming in:

Current take home pay bi-weekly after state and fed tax: 941.96 (a little over 33,000 before taxes a year)

$238.00 Car Insurance

CC 2 AMEX 9997.97 min payment 263.00 19.74% interest

Private School Loans 11934.53 payment 265.90 various interest rates.

I'm working on finding a secondary part time income, but it's tough as my government job is flex hours so my only availability is weekends and I can't commit to evenings during the week because I never know when I will have a necessary really late day. I'm trying to avoid uber and other driving jobs because I dont want to risk wear and tear and maintenance I can't afford on my vehicle. So trying online side hustles like Mturk and Clickworker while I try to find something more practical. Right now I'm looking at basically no longer being able to keep up with paying debts this month. My silver lining is that my boss has put me in to get my promotion early because of my work ethic. This would generate about 200 dollars more biweekly but no garrantee it will happen and it will still likely take a year. I'm stressed and lost. Advice?

Thank you in advance for reading and providing your recommendation on my difficult job change decision. I am 24 years old and this is my first time deciding on switching companies. Your advice would be very much appreciated!

Current employment situation:
My current employment situation is that I current work for a very large company who has recently been acquired by an even larger company. This integration provides potential future opportunities, but also uncertainty. My salary is $63k with ~$6k in bonus, and $7,500 (Total comp: in tuition reimbursement for my MBA...along with great health benefits. I have a relatively cool role, but it does not lead me to my desired career path (in terms of business functions). I have been with the company in this function for about 4 years, so I am ready for a change...but I also love the work life balance and culture, and potential opportunities with the integration. 

Potential Employment Situation; 
I received an offer at a smaller company in the sales function. The base salary is $98k with 20% potential bonus, along with similar benefits. This role get me closer to my desired career path, and is a great salary jump...but the ‘unknown’ of the culture, work life balance, etc is making me think twice about this move. 

The biggest factor that is making this decision difficult:
If I left my current employer, I would need to pay back $16k in tuition reimbursements. This isn’t a small amount of money. My first thought was to try to negotiate a signing bonus with the new employer, but they have given a strong offer and I do not want to go too far.

With these details in mind, I was hoping some of you would share your recommendations to help me solidify my decision. As mentioned, I am relatively young and have not moved companies, so your advice would be very helpful...especially with the $16k payback in mind.

Within the formally identified as food bucket (1600), it breaks down to 902 in groceries, 284 in restaurants, 232 in fast food, 128 for work lunches (primarily the sandwich shop in my building), and the remainder at coffee shops, etc.

900 a month in Groceries for 2 adults and 2 small kids is insane, especially with the amount of out of house eating we do.

I don't need to eat like a starving college student any more. But this is out of control. 

Are there any good tools for breaking down grocery receipts so we can easily see the details of where the dollars are going over time? As far as I can see no receipt scanning apps/services actually itemize anything, and it would be a ton of time to do manual data entry on every grocery trip.

I'm a ""car guy"", so I have champagne taste but a beer budget when it comes to my cars.

When the dealer ran the VIN on my car, we found out I had somehow marked the car as ""inaccurate mileage"" when I put the title in my name. A super unfortunate mistake. The dmv tells me it is permanent, regardless of its accuracy. This will make this particular car extremely hard to sell for anywhere close to what I owe on it.

Instead of walking away then and there and figuring out how to get rid of the car.. I bought the $45k car. I acknowledge how stupid this was.

My question is, is there a ""smart"" way to get rid of cars with negative equity?

That way, I should be able to take my loan payments down from $1100+ to $250. Much more manageable, and I should be able to tackle a ~$13k loan easier than $80k in auto debt.

My wife and I are currently trying to find some options to set ourselves up for better financial success. My wife is an accountant, and I have my EE degree but I am currently working at a restaurant until I can find a decent job.



I want to preface that we live in Washington State.



Currently we have about $190k in debt. $25k in credit cards (mostly mine with absurdly high interest rates), and about $160k in other debt. We have about $140k in student loan debt combined, $15k for our truck, and $8k for our wedding we just had.



Now for the interesting part. We are buying property from my grandparents for our starter place. My grandparents own an orchard, split into two parcels. One is 7.5 acres that we live on, and the other is 10 acres that they live on.

Our lot that we want to buy and split from the 7.5 has a single wide trailer that can't be financed (due to it being a tin shack), and an acre of property. We settled on 100k for the price and are currently renting to own. We are paying $750 a month in rent, and we haven't got an estimate done on the place or done any legitamate paperwork.



My grandparents are in the hole about $15k because my grandpas orchard hasn't made money in the last few years, and they are behind on their taxes (2.5 years behind) for the 10 acre parcel. Because they are planning to sell an acre to us, the part we live on is up to date on taxes. My grandpa is likely on his last year of farming, and unless they sell some property (the family doesn't want this to happen), I don't see anyway for them to be able to get out of this hole.



What I want to figure out is whether it would be a good idea to take out a ""property loan"" or something similar to give to my grandparents, and in turn they use that money to pay off their bills, and ""Gift"" some of the loaned money to us to reduce our debts. I think this would be beneficial to whipe our hands clean of credit cards with something with a much lower interest rate, and giving my grandparents some emergency funds. I was told we would need 25% down for a property loan, which could be managable, however as an accountant (and CPA) there are certain grey areas that my wife cannot delve into.



Any suggestions would be much appreciated, and if I left out some key details, please let me know!!



Thank you so much!!

We are paying $750 a month in rent, and we haven&amp;#39;t got an estimate done on the place or done any legitamate paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandparents are in the hole about $15k because my grandpas orchard hasn&amp;#39;t made money in the last few years, and they are behind on their taxes (2.5 years behind) for the 10 acre parcel. Because they are planning to sell an acre to us, the part we live on is up to date on taxes. My grandpa is likely on his last year of farming, and unless they sell some property (the family doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen), I don&amp;#39;t see anyway for them to be able to get out of this hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to figure out is whether it would be a good idea to take out a &amp;quot;property loan&amp;quot; or something similar to give to my grandparents, and in turn they use that money to pay off their bills, and &amp;quot;Gift&amp;quot; some of the loaned money to us to reduce our debts. I think this would be beneficial to whipe our hands clean of credit cards with something with a much lower interest rate, and giving my grandparents some emergency funds. I was told we would need 25% down for a property loan, which could be managable, however as an accountant (and CPA) there are certain grey areas that my wife cannot delve into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions would be much appreciated, and if I left out some key details, please let me know!!&lt;/p&gt;

I have an existing Traditional IRA. I'm attempting to open a Roth IRA and set up a Backdoor Roth IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

The balance of my IRA is currently \~$25k

I made one deductible (pre-tax) rollover contribution (from a different pre-tax retirement account) to the account, in the amount of $8300.

I have made $12,150 in non-deductible (post-tax) contributions.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping to rollover my pre-tax money to my 401(k), so that I can convert my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my research, I want to transfer the IRA balance minus the deductible (pre-tax) contributions to the 401(k),

&amp;#x200B;

So, in the example I gave, I calculate that I should be rolling over $16,700 to the 401(k). Is that correct?

&amp;#x200B;

I've also read after rolling over to the 401(k), the balance remaining in my IRA should be at least as much as my non-deductible (post-tax) contributions, which at its current state would be impossible since my non-deductible contribution amount is higher than my deductible contribution amounts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does that mean I shouldn't rollover to my 401(k), and just convert to a Roth IRA and take the tax hit? If not, what are my options?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

My wife and I are currently trying to find some options to set ourselves up for better financial success. My wife is an accountant, and I have my EE degree but I am currently working at a restaurant until I can find a decent job.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to preface that we live in Washington State.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we have about $190k in debt. $25k in credit cards (mostly mine with absurdly high interest rates), and about $160k in other debt. We have about $140k in student loan debt combined, $15k for our truck, and $8k for our wedding we just had.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the interesting part. We are buying property from my grandparents for our starter place. My grandparents own an orchard, split into two parcels. One is 7.5 acres that we live on, and the other is 10 acres that they live on.

Our lot that we want to buy and split from the 7.5 has a single wide trailer that can't be financed (due to it being a tin shack), and an acre of property. We settled on 100k for the price and are currently renting to own. We are paying $750 a month in rent, and we haven't got an estimate done on the place or done any legitamate paperwork.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandparents are in the hole about $15k because my grandpas orchard hasn't made money in the last few years, and they are behind on their taxes (2.5 years behind) for the 10 acre parcel. Because they are planning to sell an acre to us, the part we live on is up to date on taxes. My grandpa is likely on his last year of farming, and unless they sell some property (the family doesn't want this to happen), I don't see anyway for them to be able to get out of this hole.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to figure out is whether it would be a good idea to take out a ""property loan"" or something similar to give to my grandparents, and in turn they use that money to pay off their bills, and ""Gift"" some of the loaned money to us to reduce our debts. I think this would be beneficial to whipe our hands clean of credit cards with something with a much lower interest rate, and giving my grandparents some emergency funds. I was told we would need 25% down for a property loan, which could be managable, however as an accountant (and CPA) there are certain grey areas that my wife cannot delve into.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions would be much appreciated, and if I left out some key details, please let me know!!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much!!

I'm more concerned about his taxes, he currently supports his mom and files as head of household.  Should he file a new W-2 in January as Married filing Jointly even though the wedding isn't until October?  Should we talk to an accountant?  A financial planner?
As he does support his mother, and she is not financially responsible should we eventually set up a small trust for her if he passes? His assets are $35k+ in Trad 401k + ongoing 8% salary contribution with some match and $7k savings or so.   
We'll be saving more as I work with him to improve our lives (with his support and agreement) but at this time I'm just not sure where to start.  
I'd like to get a lot more financially secure and see if we can't cut our expenses... currently saving more than he has before, but I think we can do better.  We will be making about $150k together and have similar asset levels, but i save a greater percentage of my money and have better job security.  
Feel like I'm not posting enough info, but I'm more looking for directions than close examination of prior choices we can't fix.  Were making better ones now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning to get married in 2019 and we&amp;#39;re both over 35 with no kids or plans for them.
